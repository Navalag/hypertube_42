00:00:19.996 --> 00:00:23.434
<i>This is the Asgardian
refugee vessel.</i>

00:00:27.096 --> 00:00:30.744
<i>We are under assault. I
repeat, we are under assault.</i>

00:00:31.018 --> 00:00:33.783
<i>Aliens are dead, sliced open...</i>

00:00:34.885 --> 00:00:38.526
<i>Requesting aid from any
vessel within range...</i>

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:46.505
<i>Our crew is made of Asgardian
families, we have very few soldiers here.</i>

00:00:46.506 --> 00:00:50.507
<i>This is not a war craft, I
repeat, this is not a war craft.</i>

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:06.788
Hear me... and rejoice.

00:01:10.374 --> 00:01:12.576
You have had the privilege

00:01:12.776 --> 00:01:15.655
of being saved
by the Great Titan.

00:01:18.348 --> 00:01:20.902
You may think this is suffering.

00:01:21.786 --> 00:01:23.307
No.

00:01:23.507 --> 00:01:26.060
It is salvation.

00:01:30.135 --> 00:01:32.168
Universal scales

00:01:32.368 --> 00:01:35.955
tipped toward balance
because of your sacrifice.

00:01:37.370 --> 00:01:38.797
Smile

00:01:38.997 --> 00:01:41.641
for even in death

00:01:41.941 --> 00:01:44.878
you have become
Children of Thanos.

00:01:59.879 --> 00:02:02.784
I know what it's like to lose.

00:02:03.820 --> 00:02:07.736
To feel so desperately
that you're right,

00:02:07.936 --> 00:02:10.384
yet to fail nonetheless.

00:02:18.383 --> 00:02:20.511
As lightning

00:02:20.711 --> 00:02:23.729
turns the legs to jelly.

00:02:25.806 --> 00:02:28.860
I ask you
to what end?

00:02:29.415 --> 00:02:32.696
Dread it, run from it...

00:02:32.958 --> 00:02:35.520
Destiny arrives all the same.

00:02:36.583 --> 00:02:38.549
And now, it's here.

00:02:38.859 --> 00:02:40.825
Or should I say...

00:02:42.325 --> 00:02:43.856
I am.

00:02:48.994 --> 00:02:51.189
You talk too much.

00:02:51.814 --> 00:02:53.361
The Tesseract.

00:02:53.561 --> 00:02:56.048
Or, your brother's head.

00:03:00.461 --> 00:03:02.703
I assume you have a preference?

00:03:03.843 --> 00:03:05.468
Oh, I do.

00:03:07.890 --> 00:03:09.225
Kill away.

00:03:24.072 --> 00:03:25.720
All right, stop!

00:03:28.837 --> 00:03:33.047
We don't have the Tesseract.
It was destroyed on Asgard.

00:03:44.571 --> 00:03:47.227
You really are the worst, brother.

00:03:51.400 --> 00:03:55.759
I assure you, brother. The
sun will shine on us again.

00:03:57.274 --> 00:04:00.642
Your optimism is
misplaced, Asgardian.

00:04:00.696 --> 00:04:04.953
Well, for one thing,
I'm not Asgardian.

00:04:05.027 --> 00:04:06.465
And for another...

00:04:08.013 --> 00:04:09.997
we have a Hulk.

00:04:21.877 --> 00:04:23.775
Let him have his fun.

00:05:15.672 --> 00:05:17.422
Forefathers...

00:05:18.995 --> 00:05:23.846
Let the dark magic, flow
through me one last... time.

00:05:38.991 --> 00:05:40.905
That was a mistake.

00:05:46.323 --> 00:05:47.596
No!

00:05:57.147 --> 00:06:00.185
You are going to die for that!

00:06:11.098 --> 00:06:13.504
My humble personage...

00:06:14.356 --> 00:06:18.145
bows before your grandeur.

00:06:19.817 --> 00:06:23.084
No other being, has
ever had the might,

00:06:23.458 --> 00:06:25.153
nay, the nobility,

00:06:25.798 --> 00:06:30.793
to wield not one,
but two Infinity Stones.

00:06:33.623 --> 00:06:35.385
The Universe,

00:06:35.585 --> 00:06:38.701
lies within your grasp.

00:07:17.368 --> 00:07:21.055
There are two more
Stones on Earth.

00:07:21.578 --> 00:07:25.350
Find them, my Children, and
bring them to me on Titan.

00:07:25.382 --> 00:07:29.577
- Father, we will not fail you.
- If I might, interject...

00:07:29.609 --> 00:07:31.062
If you're going to Earth,

00:07:31.229 --> 00:07:33.687
you might want a guide.

00:07:33.688 --> 00:07:36.407
I do have a bit of
experience in that arena.

00:07:36.454 --> 00:07:38.891
If you consider failure experience.

00:07:39.091 --> 00:07:41.594
I consider experience, experience.

00:07:42.891 --> 00:07:44.562
Almighty Thanos.

00:07:44.841 --> 00:07:49.829
I, Loki, Prince of Asgard...

00:07:53.149 --> 00:07:55.422
Odin-son...

00:07:58.297 --> 00:08:00.673
The rightful king of Jotunheim,

00:08:00.937 --> 00:08:03.461
God of Mischief...

00:08:03.508 --> 00:08:05.759
Do hereby pledge to you,

00:08:06.458 --> 00:08:10.319
my undying fidelity.

00:08:21.193 --> 00:08:23.099
"Undying"?

00:08:26.130 --> 00:08:29.466
You should choose your
words more carefully.

00:08:50.200 --> 00:08:51.364
You...

00:08:52.341 --> 00:08:55.059
will never be...

00:08:56.622 --> 00:08:58.184
a god.

00:09:23.968 --> 00:09:27.171
No resurrections this time.

00:09:49.909 --> 00:09:52.729
No... Loki...

00:10:31.137 --> 00:10:34.160
Seriously? You don't
have any money?

00:10:34.185 --> 00:10:37.489
Attachment to the material is
detachment from the spiritual.

00:10:37.514 --> 00:10:38.873
I'll tell the guys at the deli.

00:10:38.909 --> 00:10:41.474
Maybe they'll make you a
metaphysical Ham and Rye.

00:10:41.499 --> 00:10:44.011
- Wait, wait. I think I got a 200.
- Dollars?

00:10:44.036 --> 00:10:45.982
- Rupees.
- Which is?

00:10:49.461 --> 00:10:51.851
I wouldn't say no
to a Tuna Melt.

00:11:04.053 --> 00:11:05.803
Thanos is coming.

00:11:06.381 --> 00:11:07.982
We've got to...

00:11:12.073 --> 00:11:13.199
Who?

00:11:22.504 --> 00:11:24.207
Slow down. I'm
totally not kidding.

00:11:24.232 --> 00:11:25.497
- No, I'm not.
- Your rambling lost me.

00:11:25.521 --> 00:11:28.566
Look, you know how you're having a
dream, and in the dream you gotta pee?

00:11:28.591 --> 00:11:29.331
Yeah.

00:11:29.343 --> 00:11:31.598
Okay, then you're like, my
God, there's no bathroom,

00:11:31.623 --> 00:11:33.052
what am I gonna do? Oh!
Someone's watching!

00:11:33.076 --> 00:11:36.047
Right. And then you wake up, and in
real life you actually have to pee.

00:11:36.072 --> 00:11:37.412
- Yes.
- Yeah.

00:11:37.439 --> 00:11:38.496
Everybody has that.

00:11:38.508 --> 00:11:40.900
Right. That's the point
I'm trying to make.

00:11:40.916 --> 00:11:44.743
Last night, I dreamt,
we had a kid.

00:11:44.963 --> 00:11:46.362
So real.

00:11:46.562 --> 00:11:48.431
We named him after
your eccentric uncle.

00:11:48.463 --> 00:11:51.431
- What was his name? Porsey. Morgan.
- Right.

00:11:51.752 --> 00:11:55.339
So you woke up,
and we were...

00:11:55.364 --> 00:11:56.614
- Expecting.
- Yeah.

00:11:56.622 --> 00:11:57.529
- Yes?
- No.

00:11:57.554 --> 00:12:01.007
- I had a dream about it. It was so real.
- If you wanted to have a kid...

00:12:01.046 --> 00:12:03.075
You wouldn't have done that.

00:12:03.100 --> 00:12:04.305
I'm glad you brought this up

00:12:04.382 --> 00:12:07.014
cause it's nothing,
just a housing unit for nano-parts.

00:12:07.039 --> 00:12:09.737
- It's not helping your case. OK?
- It's an attachment. It's not a...

00:12:09.761 --> 00:12:12.346
- You don't need that.
- I know. I had the surgery.

00:12:12.370 --> 00:12:15.419
I'm just trying to protect us.
The future, as is, and that's it.

00:12:15.444 --> 00:12:18.131
Just in case there's a monster in
the closet. Just letting you know.

00:12:18.162 --> 00:12:19.749
Shirts.

00:12:20.881 --> 00:12:22.568
You know me so well.

00:12:22.967 --> 00:12:24.822
You finish all my sentences.

00:12:25.077 --> 00:12:27.943
You should have shirts
in your closet.

00:12:27.975 --> 00:12:30.742
Yeah. You know what
there should be?

00:12:30.767 --> 00:12:33.681
No more surprises. We'll
have a nice dinner tonight.

00:12:35.954 --> 00:12:38.963
We should have no more surprises.
Ever. I should promise you.

00:12:38.988 --> 00:12:40.644
- Yeah.
- I will.

00:12:43.347 --> 00:12:46.522
Tony Stark,
I'm Dr. Stephen Strange.

00:12:46.722 --> 00:12:49.104
I need you to come with me.

00:12:50.104 --> 00:12:52.869
Oh. Congratulations on
the wedding, by the way.

00:12:52.894 --> 00:12:54.952
I'm sorry. You giving
out tickets or something?

00:12:54.962 --> 00:12:56.278
We need your help.

00:12:56.862 --> 00:13:00.322
Look, it's not overselling it to say that
the fate of the Universe is at stake.

00:13:00.339 --> 00:13:02.877
And who's "we"?

00:13:03.463 --> 00:13:06.346
- Hey, Tony.
- Bruce!

00:13:10.471 --> 00:13:12.689
You okay?

00:13:13.782 --> 00:13:15.832
From the dawn of the Universe,

00:13:16.235 --> 00:13:19.688
there was nothing.
Then, boom!

00:13:20.312 --> 00:13:23.758
The Big Bang sends
six elemental crystals,

00:13:23.958 --> 00:13:26.911
hurdling across the virgin Universe.

00:13:27.833 --> 00:13:29.307
These Infinity Stones

00:13:29.407 --> 00:13:32.300
each control an essential
aspect of existence.

00:13:33.302 --> 00:13:34.801
Space.

00:13:35.653 --> 00:13:37.340
Reality.

00:13:38.394 --> 00:13:39.964
Power.

00:13:40.574 --> 00:13:42.167
Soul.

00:13:43.051 --> 00:13:44.785
Mind.

00:13:46.184 --> 00:13:48.191
And Time.

00:13:57.111 --> 00:13:59.696
- Tell me his name again.
- Thanos.

00:13:59.736 --> 00:14:03.150
He's a plague, Tony. He invades planets.
He takes what he wants.

00:14:03.174 --> 00:14:07.056
He wipes out half the population.
He sent Loki.

00:14:07.814 --> 00:14:10.486
The attack on New York. That's him.

00:14:13.631 --> 00:14:15.490
- What's our time line?
- No telling.

00:14:15.498 --> 00:14:17.165
He has the Power and Space Stones,

00:14:17.265 --> 00:14:19.841
that only makes him the strongest
creature in the whole Universe.

00:14:19.866 --> 00:14:22.765
If he gets his hands, on
all six Stones, Tony...

00:14:22.790 --> 00:14:26.671
He can destroy life on a scale
of hitherto hundredth of.

00:14:26.696 --> 00:14:28.547
Did you seriously just say
"hitherto hundredth of"?

00:14:28.571 --> 00:14:30.904
Are you seriously leaning on
the Cauldron of the Cosmos?

00:14:31.004 --> 00:14:32.015
Is that what that is?

00:14:34.923 --> 00:14:36.962
I'm going to allow that.

00:14:39.020 --> 00:14:40.185
If Thanos needs all six,

00:14:40.285 --> 00:14:42.318
why don't we just stick this
one down the garbage disposal?

00:14:42.418 --> 00:14:43.153
No can do.

00:14:43.329 --> 00:14:46.394
We swore an oath to protect
the Time Stone with our lives.

00:14:46.419 --> 00:14:49.769
And I swore off dairy, but Ben &
Jerry's named a flavor after me, so...

00:14:49.778 --> 00:14:51.557
- Stark Raving Hazelnuts.
- It's not bad.

00:14:51.582 --> 00:14:52.833
A bit chalky.

00:14:53.033 --> 00:14:54.832
"A Hunka-Hulka Burning
Fudge" is our favorite.

00:14:54.840 --> 00:14:57.519
- That's a thing?
- Whatever. Point is, things change.

00:14:57.528 --> 00:15:00.200
Our oath to protect the
Time Stone cannot change.

00:15:00.208 --> 00:15:02.415
This Stone may be the best
chance we have against Thanos.

00:15:02.515 --> 00:15:05.474
And still conversely, it may also be
his best chance against us!

00:15:05.499 --> 00:15:07.144
Only if we don't do our jobs.

00:15:07.169 --> 00:15:10.294
What is your job exactly,
besides making balloon animals?

00:15:10.650 --> 00:15:13.422
Protecting your
reality, douche bag.

00:15:13.447 --> 00:15:16.587
Okay guys, can we quick cable
this discussion right now?

00:15:16.612 --> 00:15:19.986
The fact is we have the stone.
We know where it is.

00:15:20.003 --> 00:15:22.471
Vision is out there somewhere
with the Mind Stone.

00:15:22.474 --> 00:15:24.503
And we have to find him now.

00:15:24.948 --> 00:15:27.596
- Yeah, that's the thing.
- What do you mean?

00:15:27.620 --> 00:15:31.057
Two weeks ago, Vision turned off
his transponder. He's offline.

00:15:31.066 --> 00:15:32.245
What?

00:15:32.418 --> 00:15:36.041
- Tony, you lost another super bot?
- I didn't lose him. He's more than that.

00:15:36.066 --> 00:15:38.964
- He's evolving.
- Who could find Vision, then?

00:15:43.188 --> 00:15:45.789
- Probably Steve Rogers.
- Oh, great.

00:15:45.813 --> 00:15:48.586
Maybe. But...

00:15:52.126 --> 00:15:53.751
Call him.

00:15:53.946 --> 00:15:55.711
It's not that easy.

00:15:56.251 --> 00:15:58.628
God, we haven't caught up in a spell,
have we?

00:15:59.335 --> 00:16:01.642
The Avengers broke up.
We're toast.

00:16:01.790 --> 00:16:03.383
Broke up?

00:16:04.735 --> 00:16:09.149
- Like a band? Like The Beatles?
- Cap and I fell out hard.

00:16:09.759 --> 00:16:11.977
We're not on speaking terms.

00:16:12.470 --> 00:16:15.274
Tony, listen to me.

00:16:15.978 --> 00:16:18.305
Thor's gone.

00:16:19.040 --> 00:16:22.860
Thanos is coming. It doesn't matter
who you're talking to or not.

00:17:01.090 --> 00:17:04.574
Say, Doc, you wouldn't happen to
be moving your hair, would you?

00:17:04.667 --> 00:17:07.089
Not at the moment, no.

00:17:39.223 --> 00:17:40.683
You okay?

00:17:42.309 --> 00:17:45.176
- Help him. Wong, Doc.
- Got it.

00:17:45.201 --> 00:17:48.208
- Friday, what am I looking at?
- Not sure. I'm working on it.

00:17:48.233 --> 00:17:51.654
You better not put that Time
Stone in your back pocket, Doc!

00:17:51.679 --> 00:17:53.576
I might wanna use it.

00:18:20.077 --> 00:18:22.796
Ned, hey. I need you
to cause a distraction.

00:18:22.806 --> 00:18:24.116
Holy shit!

00:18:24.186 --> 00:18:28.646
We're all gonna die!
There's a spaceship!

00:18:36.997 --> 00:18:38.549
What's the matter with you kids?

00:18:38.588 --> 00:18:41.098
You never seen a spaceship before?

00:18:52.554 --> 00:18:56.600
Friday, evac anyone south of 43rd
Street, notify first responders.

00:18:56.616 --> 00:18:57.780
Will do.

00:19:25.834 --> 00:19:29.271
Hear me, and rejoice!

00:19:30.116 --> 00:19:34.428
You are about to die at the hands
of the Children of Thanos.

00:19:34.732 --> 00:19:39.349
Be thankful, that your meaningless
lives are now contributing to...

00:19:39.365 --> 00:19:42.396
I'm sorry, Earth is closed today.

00:19:42.412 --> 00:19:45.243
You better pack it up
and get outta here.

00:19:45.343 --> 00:19:46.755
Stone keeper...

00:19:47.146 --> 00:19:49.468
Does this chattering
animal speak for you?

00:19:49.493 --> 00:19:51.424
Certainly not. I speak for myself.

00:19:51.702 --> 00:19:54.953
There's no trespassing in
this city and on this planet.

00:19:55.141 --> 00:19:58.571
- You need to get lost, Squidward!
- They exhaust me.

00:19:58.641 --> 00:20:00.445
Bring me the Stone.

00:20:01.782 --> 00:20:03.836
Hey, do you want a piece?

00:20:04.578 --> 00:20:08.117
No, not really. But when
do I ever get what I want.

00:20:10.289 --> 00:20:13.835
Been a while. Good
to have you, buddy.

00:20:14.302 --> 00:20:17.686
I just... I need to
concentrate for a second.

00:20:17.711 --> 00:20:19.669
Come on, come on, Max.

00:20:22.338 --> 00:20:24.548
Where's your guy?

00:20:25.018 --> 00:20:26.791
I don't know. We're
certainly having a thing.

00:20:26.816 --> 00:20:30.441
There's no time for a thing. That's
the thing right there. Let's go.

00:20:36.521 --> 00:20:39.239
Dude, you're embarrassing me
in front of the wizards.

00:20:39.271 --> 00:20:41.739
- I can't... He won't...
- It's okay. Stand down.

00:20:41.764 --> 00:20:44.006
- Can I leave you with him? Thank you.
- I have him.

00:21:12.468 --> 00:21:17.068
- Where'd that come from?
- It's nano-tech. You like it? A little...

00:21:19.617 --> 00:21:23.410
Dr. Banner, if the rest of your
green friend won't be joining us...

00:21:32.658 --> 00:21:35.767
- You gotta get that stone outta here, now.
- It stays with me.

00:21:35.792 --> 00:21:37.424
Exactly. Bye!

00:21:46.395 --> 00:21:49.191
Tony, you okay? How we doing?
Good, bad?

00:21:49.216 --> 00:21:51.397
Really good. Do you plan on helping out?

00:21:51.497 --> 00:21:53.410
I'm trying. He won't come out.

00:22:03.066 --> 00:22:05.949
Come on, Hulk. What
are you doing?

00:22:06.019 --> 00:22:08.394
Come on. Come on! Come on!

00:22:08.425 --> 00:22:10.862
No!

00:22:14.425 --> 00:22:17.339
What do you mean, "no"?

00:22:22.074 --> 00:22:25.222
- Hey, man! What's up, Mr. Stark?
- Kid, where'd you come from?

00:22:25.246 --> 00:22:27.441
The field trip.

00:22:28.426 --> 00:22:31.131
What is this guy's problem, Mr.
Stark?

00:22:31.156 --> 00:22:34.757
He's from space, came here to
steal a necklace from a wizard.

00:23:00.907 --> 00:23:05.602
Your powers are quaint. You
must be popular with children.

00:23:07.430 --> 00:23:09.733
It's a simple spell
but quite unbreakable.

00:23:09.733 --> 00:23:11.944
Then I'll take it
off your corpse.

00:23:23.979 --> 00:23:29.760
You wouldn't. Removing a dead
man's spell... Troublesome.

00:23:29.776 --> 00:23:32.158
You'll only wish you were dead.

00:23:41.777 --> 00:23:43.199
No!

00:23:46.574 --> 00:23:49.167
- Kid, that's the wizard. Get on it.
- On it!

00:23:57.310 --> 00:23:59.669
Not cool.

00:24:13.803 --> 00:24:18.693
- Mr. Stark? I'm being beamed up.
- Hang on, kid.

00:24:38.338 --> 00:24:41.166
Wong, you're invited
to my wedding.

00:24:47.779 --> 00:24:49.927
Give me a little juice, Friday.

00:24:57.843 --> 00:25:00.022
Unlock 17-A.

00:25:12.247 --> 00:25:14.879
Kid, you gotta let go.
I'm gonna catch you.

00:25:14.891 --> 00:25:16.731
But you said save the wizard!

00:25:16.778 --> 00:25:18.552
I can't breathe!

00:25:18.577 --> 00:25:21.317
You're too high up. You're
running out of air.

00:25:22.481 --> 00:25:24.738
That makes sense.

00:25:40.846 --> 00:25:43.122
Mr. Stark, it smells
like a new car in here.

00:25:43.147 --> 00:25:46.420
- Happy trails, kid. Friday, send him home.
- Yup.

00:25:46.428 --> 00:25:48.037
Oh, come on!

00:25:55.961 --> 00:25:58.257
Boss, incoming call
from Miss Potts.

00:25:58.283 --> 00:26:00.783
Tony? Oh, my God. Are you all right?
What's going on?

00:26:00.808 --> 00:26:03.814
Yeah, I'm fine. I just think we
might have to push our 8:30 res.

00:26:03.830 --> 00:26:04.532
Why?

00:26:04.532 --> 00:26:07.877
Just 'cause I'll probably
not make it back for awhile.

00:26:08.300 --> 00:26:10.682
- Tell me you're not on that ship.
- Yeah.

00:26:10.707 --> 00:26:13.032
God, no. Please tell me
you're not on that ship.

00:26:13.044 --> 00:26:14.464
Honey, I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

00:26:14.480 --> 00:26:15.927
I don't know how to say this. Pep...

00:26:16.027 --> 00:26:17.855
Come back here, Tony. I swear to God...
Come back here right now!

00:26:18.769 --> 00:26:20.143
Come back!

00:26:20.144 --> 00:26:24.690
Boss, we're losing her.
I'm going, too...

00:26:33.183 --> 00:26:35.464
Oh, my God.

00:26:38.871 --> 00:26:41.676
I should have stayed on the bus.

00:26:55.162 --> 00:26:58.591
- Where you going?
- Time Stone's been taken.

00:26:58.616 --> 00:27:00.906
The Sanctum remains unguarded.

00:27:01.106 --> 00:27:02.404
What will you do?

00:27:03.096 --> 00:27:06.017
I'm gonna make a call.

00:27:45.137 --> 00:27:47.183
Sing it, Drax!

00:27:58.995 --> 00:28:00.549
Why are we doing this again?

00:28:00.574 --> 00:28:03.269
It's a distress signal, Rocket.
Someone could be dying.

00:28:03.294 --> 00:28:07.277
- I get that, but why are we doing it?
- 'Cause we're nice.

00:28:07.441 --> 00:28:10.225
And maybe whoever it is will give us a
little cheddar cheese for our help...

00:28:10.249 --> 00:28:13.840
- Which isn't the point.
- Which isn't the point... I mean...

00:28:13.865 --> 00:28:16.000
- If he doesn't pony up...
- We'll take his ship.

00:28:16.025 --> 00:28:19.974
- Exactly! Alright!
- B-b-b-bingo!

00:28:22.020 --> 00:28:24.153
We are arriving.

00:28:24.178 --> 00:28:26.644
All right, Guardians.
Don't forget, this might

00:28:26.656 --> 00:28:29.082
be dangerous, so let's
put on our mean faces.

00:28:33.861 --> 00:28:37.677
Groot, put that thing away. Now.
I don't wanna tell you again. Groot.

00:28:37.686 --> 00:28:39.357
I am Groot!

00:28:39.381 --> 00:28:41.662
- Whoa! Language!
- Wow!

00:28:41.687 --> 00:28:43.506
You got some acorns on you, kid.

00:28:43.531 --> 00:28:47.015
Ever since you got little
sap, you're a total d-hole.

00:28:47.047 --> 00:28:50.750
Keep it up, and I'm gonna
smash that thing to pieces!

00:28:57.492 --> 00:29:00.195
What happened?

00:29:02.848 --> 00:29:05.238
Oh, my God.

00:29:10.160 --> 00:29:12.691
Looks like we're
not getting paid.

00:29:14.402 --> 00:29:17.745
Wipers! Wipers! Get it off.

00:29:24.069 --> 00:29:27.123
How the hell is this
dude still alive?

00:29:27.147 --> 00:29:30.772
He is not a dude. You're a dude.

00:29:30.874 --> 00:29:34.389
This... This is a man.

00:29:34.460 --> 00:29:38.085
- Handsome, muscular man.
- I'm muscular.

00:29:38.093 --> 00:29:41.085
Who are you kidding, Quill? You're
one sandwich away from fat.

00:29:41.093 --> 00:29:45.162
- Yeah, right. What?
- It's true. You have little weight...

00:29:46.780 --> 00:29:49.123
Gamora, do you think I'm...

00:29:51.272 --> 00:29:54.227
He is anxious. Angry.

00:29:54.427 --> 00:29:58.373
He feels tremendous
loss and guilt.

00:29:58.563 --> 00:30:01.555
It's like a pirate had
a baby with an angel.

00:30:01.580 --> 00:30:04.346
Wow. This is a real wake-up
call for me. Okay.

00:30:04.371 --> 00:30:05.616
I'm gonna get a Bowflex.

00:30:05.840 --> 00:30:08.325
I'm gonna commit.
I'm gonna get some dumbbells.

00:30:08.421 --> 00:30:09.981
You know you can't eat
dumbbells, right?

00:30:10.122 --> 00:30:13.869
It's like his muscles are
made of Cotati metal fiber.

00:30:13.881 --> 00:30:15.895
Stop massaging his muscles.

00:30:17.183 --> 00:30:19.018
Wake him up.

00:30:21.006 --> 00:30:22.249
Wake.

00:30:39.651 --> 00:30:42.291
Who the hell are you guys?

00:30:44.557 --> 00:30:48.424
The entire time I knew Thanos,
he only ever had one goal:

00:30:48.432 --> 00:30:52.228
To bring balance to the Universe
by wiping out half of all life.

00:30:52.626 --> 00:30:57.307
He used to kill people planet by
planet, massacre by massacre.

00:30:57.323 --> 00:31:00.390
- Including my own.
- If he gets all six Infinity Stones,

00:31:00.429 --> 00:31:03.335
he can do it with the snap
of his fingers, like this.

00:31:03.652 --> 00:31:07.694
You seem to know a
great deal about Thanos.

00:31:07.706 --> 00:31:11.144
Gamora... is the
daughter of Thanos.

00:31:14.302 --> 00:31:17.715
- Your father killed my brother.
- Oh, boy.

00:31:17.716 --> 00:31:22.380
Stepfather. Technically, she
hates him as much as you do.

00:31:25.006 --> 00:31:26.335
Thanos can be tough.

00:31:26.830 --> 00:31:30.551
Look. Before my father died,
he told me I had a half-sister...

00:31:30.576 --> 00:31:33.703
that he imprisoned in Hell.
Then she returned

00:31:33.715 --> 00:31:37.364
home, and stabbed me in the eye,
so... I had to kill her.

00:31:37.564 --> 00:31:39.367
It's life, there was nothing else.

00:31:41.936 --> 00:31:45.320
- And I feel your pain.
- I feel your pain, as well.

00:31:45.345 --> 00:31:47.900
I mean it's not a competition,
but I've been through a lot.

00:31:47.925 --> 00:31:52.956
My father killed my mother, then I had
to kill my father. And that was hard.

00:31:52.972 --> 00:31:55.920
Probably even harder than
having to kill a sister.

00:31:55.945 --> 00:31:59.179
Plus, I, came out
with both of my eyes.

00:31:59.195 --> 00:32:01.952
I need a hammer, not a spoon...

00:32:02.508 --> 00:32:03.895
How do I open this thing?

00:32:03.923 --> 00:32:07.977
Is there some sort of a
four-digit code maybe...

00:32:08.177 --> 00:32:11.024
- Maybe a birth date or something...
- What are you doing?

00:32:11.025 --> 00:32:12.272
Taking your pod.

00:32:13.768 --> 00:32:15.572
No, you're not!

00:32:16.686 --> 00:32:21.646
You'll not, be taking
our pod today, sir.

00:32:22.178 --> 00:32:25.293
Quill. Are you making your voice deeper?

00:32:26.861 --> 00:32:28.242
- No.
- You are.

00:32:28.442 --> 00:32:31.211
You're imitating the god-man.
It's weird.

00:32:31.236 --> 00:32:33.546
- No I'm not.
- He just did it again!

00:32:33.571 --> 00:32:36.525
This is my voice!

00:32:40.607 --> 00:32:43.810
- Are you mocking me?
- Are you mocking me?

00:32:43.835 --> 00:32:45.913
You just did it again.

00:32:45.960 --> 00:32:48.006
He's trying to copy me.

00:32:48.031 --> 00:32:51.389
Enough! We need to stop Thanos.

00:32:51.414 --> 00:32:54.209
Which means we need to find
out where he's going next.

00:32:54.221 --> 00:32:55.241
Nowhere.

00:32:55.422 --> 00:33:00.007
- He must be going somewhere.
- No. Nowhere? It's a place.

00:33:00.023 --> 00:33:01.681
We've been there. It sucks.

00:33:01.881 --> 00:33:03.539
Excuse me, that's our food.

00:33:03.555 --> 00:33:05.844
- Not anymore.
- Thor...

00:33:05.869 --> 00:33:08.421
Why would he go to nowhere?

00:33:08.446 --> 00:33:11.293
Because for years,
reality stone has been safely stored,

00:33:11.493 --> 00:33:13.564
there with a man
we call the collector.

00:33:13.788 --> 00:33:15.543
If it's with the Collector,
then it's not safe.

00:33:15.743 --> 00:33:17.368
Only an idiot would
give that man a stone.

00:33:17.411 --> 00:33:18.420
Or a genius.

00:33:18.520 --> 00:33:21.231
How do you know he's not going
for one of the other stones?

00:33:21.364 --> 00:33:24.192
There's six stones out there.

00:33:24.208 --> 00:33:28.052
Thanos already has the Power Stone
because he stole it last week,

00:33:28.077 --> 00:33:29.996
when he decimated Xandar.

00:33:30.196 --> 00:33:32.321
He stole the Space Stone from me.

00:33:32.336 --> 00:33:35.281
When he destroyed my ship and
slaughtered half my people.

00:33:35.306 --> 00:33:38.290
The Time and Mind Stones are safe on Earth.
They're with the Avengers.

00:33:38.315 --> 00:33:40.636
- The Avengers?
- They're Earth's Mightiest Heroes.

00:33:40.661 --> 00:33:43.638
- Like Kevin Bacon?
- He may be on the team. I don't know.

00:33:43.838 --> 00:33:44.870
Haven't been there in a while.

00:33:45.224 --> 00:33:47.161
As for the Soul Stone,
no one's ever seen that.

00:33:47.361 --> 00:33:48.666
No one even knows where it is.

00:33:48.737 --> 00:33:52.244
Therefore, Thanos can't get it.
Therefore, he's going to Nowhere.

00:33:52.253 --> 00:33:55.666
Hence, he'll be getting the Reality Stone.
You're welcome.

00:33:55.682 --> 00:33:58.697
- Then we have to go to Nowhere now.
- Wrong.

00:33:58.706 --> 00:34:02.308
- Where we have to go, is Nivadellir.
- That's a made up word.

00:34:02.333 --> 00:34:06.372
- Oh what's made up?
- Nidavellir is real? Seriously?

00:34:06.756 --> 00:34:09.455
I mean, that place is a legend. They
make the most powerful,

00:34:09.467 --> 00:34:11.872
horrific weapons to ever
torment the Universe.

00:34:11.897 --> 00:34:14.047
I would very much like
to go there, please.

00:34:14.072 --> 00:34:16.327
The rabbit is correct, and
clearly the smartest one.

00:34:16.747 --> 00:34:17.648
Rabbit?

00:34:17.671 --> 00:34:20.181
Only Eitri the dwarf king can
make me the weapon I need.

00:34:20.205 --> 00:34:22.623
- I assume you're the captain, sir?
- You're very perceptive.

00:34:22.648 --> 00:34:25.866
You seem like a noble leader. Will you
join me on my quest to Nivadellir?

00:34:25.891 --> 00:34:29.669
Lemme just ask the captain. Wait a
second, it's me! Yeah, I'll go.

00:34:29.869 --> 00:34:32.312
- Wonderful.
- Except that I'm the captain.

00:34:32.337 --> 00:34:33.868
- Quiet!
- And that's my backpack.

00:34:33.892 --> 00:34:36.469
- Quill, sit down.
- Look, this is my ship.

00:34:36.485 --> 00:34:38.203
And I'm not going to...

00:34:39.195 --> 00:34:41.609
Wait, what kind of weapon
are we talking about here?

00:34:41.618 --> 00:34:43.625
The Thanos killing kind.

00:34:43.650 --> 00:34:45.496
Don't you think that we should
all have a weapon like that?

00:34:45.520 --> 00:34:47.691
No. You simply lack the
strength to wield them.

00:34:47.708 --> 00:34:50.251
Your bodies will crumble as you
minds collapse to the madness.

00:34:50.275 --> 00:34:52.160
Is it weird that I wanna
do it even more now?

00:34:52.172 --> 00:34:53.295
A little bit. Yeah.

00:34:53.495 --> 00:34:56.144
If we don't go to Nowhere and
Thanos retrieves another stone,

00:34:56.168 --> 00:34:58.714
- he'll be too powerful to stop.
- He already is.

00:34:58.738 --> 00:35:00.525
I got it figured out.

00:35:00.550 --> 00:35:04.042
We got two ships, and the
largest go with the morons.

00:35:04.059 --> 00:35:06.366
So me and Groot will go
with the pirate-angel here,

00:35:06.391 --> 00:35:09.711
and the morons will go to
Nowhere to try and stop Thanos.

00:35:10.039 --> 00:35:12.305
- Cool? Cool.
- So cool.

00:35:12.329 --> 00:35:14.078
For the record...

00:35:14.125 --> 00:35:16.798
I know that you're only going with
him because it's where Thanos isn't.

00:35:16.822 --> 00:35:21.173
You know, you shouldn't talk
that way to your captain, Quill.

00:35:21.564 --> 00:35:23.383
Come on, Groot.

00:35:23.583 --> 00:35:26.040
Put that game down.
You'll rot your brain.

00:35:30.363 --> 00:35:33.941
I bid you farewell and
good luck, morons. Bye.

00:35:48.657 --> 00:35:49.790
Vis?

00:35:50.334 --> 00:35:52.092
Is it the stone again?

00:35:52.138 --> 00:35:54.375
It's as if it's speaking to me.

00:35:54.626 --> 00:35:56.618
What does it say?

00:35:57.267 --> 00:36:00.556
I don't... I don't know.
Something...

00:36:12.908 --> 00:36:15.283
Tell me what you feel.

00:36:22.396 --> 00:36:25.762
I just feel you.

00:36:33.588 --> 00:36:35.540
So there's a 10 AM to Glasgow

00:36:35.740 --> 00:36:37.884
to give us more time together
before you went back.

00:36:37.916 --> 00:36:40.908
- What if I miss that train?
- There is an 11.

00:36:40.939 --> 00:36:43.689
What if I missed all the trains?

00:36:44.588 --> 00:36:46.681
What if this time,
I didn't go back?

00:36:46.706 --> 00:36:49.331
- You gave Stark your word.
- I'd rather give it to you.

00:36:49.356 --> 00:36:52.801
There are people who are expecting me
too, you know. We both made promises.

00:36:52.809 --> 00:36:54.496
Not to each other.

00:36:55.334 --> 00:36:56.777
Wanda...

00:36:56.928 --> 00:37:00.716
Two years, we've stolen these moments,
trying to see if this could work.

00:37:00.741 --> 00:37:05.302
And... I don't know. You know what,
I'm just gonna speak for myself.

00:37:05.327 --> 00:37:09.819
- I, I... I think... It works.
- It works. It works.

00:37:12.257 --> 00:37:14.061
Stay.

00:37:21.019 --> 00:37:24.214
Or not. If I'm overstepping...

00:37:31.190 --> 00:37:33.252
What are they?

00:37:33.362 --> 00:37:36.549
What the stone was
warning me about.

00:37:45.599 --> 00:37:50.317
- I have to go.
- No. Vision. If that's true...

00:37:50.490 --> 00:37:53.427
Then maybe going isn't
the best idea.

00:37:54.021 --> 00:37:55.607
Wanda, I...

00:38:25.154 --> 00:38:28.481
The blade. It stopped
me from phasing.

00:38:28.865 --> 00:38:32.265
- Is that even possible?
- It isn't supposed to be.

00:38:39.703 --> 00:38:41.187
Vis!

00:38:49.835 --> 00:38:53.897
Give up the Stone,
and she lives.

00:39:31.114 --> 00:39:32.590
Hands off.

00:39:49.628 --> 00:39:53.620
Come on. You gotta get up.
You gotta get up. Come on.

00:39:55.307 --> 00:39:57.689
We have to go.

00:39:59.526 --> 00:40:03.017
- Please leave.
- You asked me to stay.

00:40:03.932 --> 00:40:06.182
I'm staying.

00:41:16.467 --> 00:41:18.193
- Get up.
- I can't.

00:41:18.240 --> 00:41:21.037
We don't wanna kill you.
But we will.

00:41:21.084 --> 00:41:24.162
You'll never get
the chance again.

00:41:39.119 --> 00:41:40.822
Can you stand?

00:41:45.579 --> 00:41:48.407
Thank you, Captain.

00:41:49.520 --> 00:41:52.118
Let's get you on the jet.

00:41:55.345 --> 00:41:58.486
I thought
we had a deal.

00:41:58.541 --> 00:42:02.400
Stay close, check in.
Don't take any chances.

00:42:02.494 --> 00:42:06.501
I'm sorry. We just wanted time.

00:42:08.689 --> 00:42:10.783
Where to, Cap?

00:42:12.916 --> 00:42:14.556
Home.

00:42:17.587 --> 00:42:19.805
We'll be safe.

00:42:44.341 --> 00:42:47.021
- Zen-Whoberians...
- Mother!

00:42:47.061 --> 00:42:50.334
- Choose a side, or die.
- Mother!

00:42:50.825 --> 00:42:55.926
One side, for reservation.
The other, an honor...

00:42:56.973 --> 00:42:59.276
What's wrong, little one?

00:42:59.301 --> 00:43:03.269
My mother. Where is my mother?

00:43:07.065 --> 00:43:09.303
What's your name?

00:43:09.671 --> 00:43:11.819
Gamora.

00:43:11.952 --> 00:43:15.272
You're quite the
fighter, Gamora.

00:43:15.670 --> 00:43:19.568
Come. Let me help you.

00:43:31.397 --> 00:43:33.287
Look.

00:43:36.241 --> 00:43:40.365
Pretty, isn't it?
Perfectly balanced.

00:43:40.397 --> 00:43:42.506
As all things should be.

00:43:42.538 --> 00:43:47.482
Too much to one side,
or the other...

00:43:49.783 --> 00:43:53.704
Here. You try.

00:43:56.754 --> 00:44:01.160
Now go in peace, and
meet your maker.

00:44:04.954 --> 00:44:07.492
Concentrate.

00:44:09.485 --> 00:44:13.616
There! You've got it.

00:44:21.817 --> 00:44:23.504
Gamora.

00:44:23.837 --> 00:44:27.973
You know these grenades are the
"blow off your junk" kind or the gas kind?

00:44:27.996 --> 00:44:30.675
'Cause I was thinking I might hang
a couple on my belt right here.

00:44:30.699 --> 00:44:33.722
- But I don't want to...
- I need to ask a favor.

00:44:33.746 --> 00:44:35.652
Yeah, sure.

00:44:36.566 --> 00:44:40.499
One way or another, the path
that we're on leads to Thanos.

00:44:41.699 --> 00:44:44.425
Which is what the
grenades are for.

00:44:44.652 --> 00:44:46.852
I'm sorry. What's the favor?

00:44:48.416 --> 00:44:50.955
If things go wrong...

00:44:51.244 --> 00:44:53.814
If Thanos gets me...

00:44:57.909 --> 00:45:02.401
I want you to promise me...
you'll kill me.

00:45:02.479 --> 00:45:04.190
What?

00:45:06.839 --> 00:45:09.807
I know something he doesn't.

00:45:11.808 --> 00:45:13.979
If he finds it out...

00:45:14.004 --> 00:45:17.300
- The entire Universe could be at risk.
- What do you know?

00:45:17.324 --> 00:45:20.230
If I tell you, you'd know, too.

00:45:22.204 --> 00:45:25.938
If it's so important,
shouldn't I?

00:45:25.963 --> 00:45:27.131
Only if you wanna die.

00:45:27.143 --> 00:45:29.994
Why does somebody always
have to die in this scenario?

00:45:30.072 --> 00:45:31.502
Just...

00:45:33.206 --> 00:45:36.502
trust me. And
possibly, kill me.

00:45:36.534 --> 00:45:40.846
I mean, I'd like to.
I really would...

00:45:40.994 --> 00:45:43.205
Swear to me.

00:45:45.775 --> 00:45:48.660
Swear to me on your mother.

00:45:55.269 --> 00:45:57.081
Okay.

00:46:19.840 --> 00:46:22.582
Dude! How long have you
been standing there?

00:46:22.606 --> 00:46:25.348
- An hour.
- An hour?

00:46:25.403 --> 00:46:27.066
Are you serious?

00:46:27.083 --> 00:46:32.887
I've mastered the ability, of
standing so incredibly still...

00:46:33.278 --> 00:46:37.886
That I've become invisible
to the eye. Watch.

00:46:41.267 --> 00:46:45.344
- You're eating a zark nut.
- But my movement...

00:46:45.470 --> 00:46:47.766
So slow...

00:46:47.814 --> 00:46:52.102
- And it's imperceptible.
- No.

00:46:52.157 --> 00:46:55.071
- I'm sure I'm invisible.
- Hi, Drax.

00:46:57.485 --> 00:46:59.149
Damn it.

00:47:18.303 --> 00:47:21.919
- This place looks deserted.
- I'm reading movement.

00:47:21.944 --> 00:47:25.686
- From the third quadrant.
- Yeah. I'm picking that up, too.

00:47:26.632 --> 00:47:29.398
Let's put it down over here.

00:47:58.053 --> 00:48:00.733
I know you have the Reality Stone.

00:48:00.963 --> 00:48:05.568
Giving it to me will spare you
a great deal of suffering.

00:48:08.368 --> 00:48:12.578
I told you. I sold it.

00:48:14.512 --> 00:48:19.746
- Why would I lie?
- I imagine it's like breathing for you.

00:48:20.160 --> 00:48:24.050
- Like suicide.
- So you do understand.

00:48:24.090 --> 00:48:26.933
Not even you will surrender
something so precious.

00:48:26.965 --> 00:48:29.097
I didn't know what it was.

00:48:29.105 --> 00:48:32.238
Then you're more of a
fool than I took you for.

00:48:32.246 --> 00:48:35.300
Last chance, Charlotte.

00:48:36.110 --> 00:48:38.110
Where's the Stone?

00:48:38.227 --> 00:48:43.211
Today, he pays for the deaths
of my wife and daughter.

00:48:43.243 --> 00:48:44.859
Drax, wait!

00:48:45.368 --> 00:48:47.602
Whoa, not yet!

00:48:54.257 --> 00:48:57.069
He doesn't have the Stone yet.

00:48:57.101 --> 00:48:59.405
We get it, and then
we can stop him.

00:48:59.446 --> 00:49:02.289
We have to get the Stone first.
Yeah.

00:49:02.360 --> 00:49:07.719
No. No. For Ovette.
For Camaria.

00:49:07.751 --> 00:49:09.633
Sleep.

00:49:20.857 --> 00:49:26.075
Okay. Gamora, Mantis,
you go right.

00:49:26.091 --> 00:49:29.395
I'm... The other right!

00:49:52.673 --> 00:49:55.251
Why?

00:50:04.227 --> 00:50:08.680
Why you? Daughter...

00:50:27.157 --> 00:50:29.344
That was quick.

00:50:33.880 --> 00:50:39.317
Magnificent! Magnificent!

00:50:41.184 --> 00:50:44.825
Is it sadness I sense
in you, daughter?

00:50:46.997 --> 00:50:50.622
In my heart, I knew
you still cared.

00:50:56.828 --> 00:51:00.007
No one ever knows for sure.

00:51:09.384 --> 00:51:12.970
Reality is often disappointing.

00:51:15.433 --> 00:51:18.675
That is, it was.

00:51:19.667 --> 00:51:21.253
Now...

00:51:23.102 --> 00:51:26.555
Reality can be whatever I want.

00:51:27.219 --> 00:51:30.820
- You knew I'd come.
- I counted on it.

00:51:31.246 --> 00:51:35.074
There's something we need
to discuss, little one.

00:51:38.862 --> 00:51:40.877
Thanos!

00:51:53.807 --> 00:51:57.533
- Let her go, Grimace!
- Peter...

00:51:58.214 --> 00:52:01.057
- I told you to go right.
- Now...

00:52:01.096 --> 00:52:05.588
- You let her go!
- Ah, the boyfriend.

00:52:06.291 --> 00:52:10.509
I like to think of myself more as a
Titan-killing long term booty call.

00:52:10.533 --> 00:52:12.494
- Let her go.
- Peter...

00:52:12.518 --> 00:52:17.166
Or I'm gonna blow that nut-sack
of a chin right off your face!

00:52:17.565 --> 00:52:20.486
Not him.

00:52:29.669 --> 00:52:32.598
You promised!

00:52:37.726 --> 00:52:42.155
Oh, daughter. You expect
too much from him.

00:52:45.442 --> 00:52:48.379
She's asked, hasn't she?

00:52:50.880 --> 00:52:52.457
Do it.

00:52:58.192 --> 00:53:00.027
Do it!

00:53:06.605 --> 00:53:09.230
I told you to go right!

00:53:09.926 --> 00:53:13.097
I love you, more than anything.

00:53:16.003 --> 00:53:18.645
I love you, too.

00:53:31.631 --> 00:53:33.560
I like you.

00:54:03.654 --> 00:54:05.387
Still no word from Vision?

00:54:05.420 --> 00:54:08.076
Satellites lost him
somewhere over Edinburgh.

00:54:08.092 --> 00:54:12.060
On a stolen quinjet with four of
the world's most wanted criminals.

00:54:12.076 --> 00:54:13.282
You know they're only criminals

00:54:13.482 --> 00:54:15.506
because you've chosen to call them that,
right, sir?

00:54:15.531 --> 00:54:19.946
My God, Rhodes, your talent
for horseshit rivals my own.

00:54:19.969 --> 00:54:23.413
If it weren't for those Accords,
Vision would've been right here.

00:54:23.421 --> 00:54:26.921
I remember your signature
on those papers, Colonel.

00:54:27.163 --> 00:54:28.778
That's right.

00:54:30.425 --> 00:54:32.178
And I'm pretty sure
I've paid for that.

00:54:32.203 --> 00:54:35.507
- Do you have second thoughts?
- Not anymore.

00:54:41.153 --> 00:54:44.426
Mr. Secretary.

00:54:47.099 --> 00:54:50.817
You got some nerve.
I'll give you that.

00:54:51.273 --> 00:54:53.786
You could use some
of that right now.

00:54:53.919 --> 00:54:56.817
The world's on fire.

00:54:56.896 --> 00:55:00.474
And you think, all is forgiven?

00:55:00.568 --> 00:55:05.333
I'm not looking for forgiveness. And
I'm way past asking for permission.

00:55:06.451 --> 00:55:11.434
Earth just lost her best defender.
So we're here to fight.

00:55:11.747 --> 00:55:14.356
And if you wanna
stand in our way...

00:55:14.943 --> 00:55:17.099
We'll fight you, too.

00:55:20.158 --> 00:55:23.720
- Arrest them.
- All over it.

00:55:28.876 --> 00:55:31.086
That's a court-martial.

00:55:32.844 --> 00:55:36.548
- It's great to see you, Cap.
- You too, Rhodey.

00:55:36.573 --> 00:55:37.902
Hey.

00:55:39.643 --> 00:55:44.213
Well. You guys, really
look like crap.

00:55:44.268 --> 00:55:46.033
Must've been a rough
couple of years.

00:55:46.049 --> 00:55:49.181
Yeah, well, the hotels
weren't exactly five star.

00:55:49.190 --> 00:55:51.494
I think you look great.

00:55:58.320 --> 00:56:00.655
Yeah. I'm back.

00:56:01.929 --> 00:56:03.538
Hi, Bruce.

00:56:08.456 --> 00:56:10.034
Nat.

00:56:12.854 --> 00:56:15.424
This is awkward.

00:56:16.888 --> 00:56:18.789
We gotta assume they're
coming back, right?

00:56:18.801 --> 00:56:20.131
And they can clearly find us.

00:56:20.146 --> 00:56:22.575
We need all hands on deck.
Where's Clint?

00:56:22.583 --> 00:56:24.951
After the whole Accords
situation, he and Scott

00:56:24.963 --> 00:56:27.293
took a deal. It's too
tough on their families.

00:56:27.318 --> 00:56:28.864
- Who's Scott?
- Ant-Man.

00:56:28.888 --> 00:56:31.286
There's an Ant-Man
and a Spider-Man?

00:56:31.310 --> 00:56:32.310
Okay, look...

00:56:32.333 --> 00:56:35.333
Thanos has the biggest
army in the Universe.

00:56:35.349 --> 00:56:39.293
And he is not gonna
stop until he... He gets...

00:56:40.984 --> 00:56:41.991
Vision's stone.

00:56:42.016 --> 00:56:45.968
- Well then, we have to protect it.
- No, we have to destroy it.

00:56:47.309 --> 00:56:51.762
I've been giving a good deal of thought to
this entity in my head about its nature.

00:56:51.778 --> 00:56:54.043
But also, its composition.

00:56:54.086 --> 00:56:56.737
I think if it were exposed
to a sufficiently

00:56:56.749 --> 00:56:58.820
powerful energy
source, something,

00:56:58.845 --> 00:57:02.610
very similar to its own
signature, perhaps...

00:57:03.618 --> 00:57:06.540
Its molecular
integrity could fail.

00:57:06.673 --> 00:57:08.993
And you, with it.

00:57:09.087 --> 00:57:10.743
We're not having
this conversation.

00:57:10.755 --> 00:57:13.344
Eliminating the stone is the
only way to be certain that

00:57:13.369 --> 00:57:17.937
- Thanos can't get it.
- That's too high a price.

00:57:21.873 --> 00:57:25.404
Only you, have the
power to pay it.

00:57:28.553 --> 00:57:30.695
Thanos threatens
half the Universe.

00:57:30.720 --> 00:57:34.151
One life cannot stand in
the way of defeating him.

00:57:34.163 --> 00:57:35.310
But it should.

00:57:37.115 --> 00:57:38.546
We don't trade lives, Vision.

00:57:38.571 --> 00:57:42.929
Captain, 70 years ago, you laid down
your life to save millions of people.

00:57:42.954 --> 00:57:45.063
Tell me, why is
this any different?

00:57:45.094 --> 00:57:48.430
Because you might have a choice.

00:57:48.696 --> 00:57:52.742
Your mind is made up of a
complex construct of overlays.

00:57:52.751 --> 00:57:56.487
Jarvis, Ultron, Tony,
me, the stone.

00:57:56.526 --> 00:58:00.320
All of them mixed together. All of
them learning from one another.

00:58:00.345 --> 00:58:03.515
- You're saying Vision isn't just a stone?
- I'm saying that...

00:58:03.540 --> 00:58:07.250
If we take out the stone, there's
still a whole lot of Vision left.

00:58:07.259 --> 00:58:10.446
- Perhaps the best parts.
- Can we do that?

00:58:10.765 --> 00:58:12.499
Not me. Not here.

00:58:12.825 --> 00:58:15.843
Well you better find someone
and somewhere fast.

00:58:15.885 --> 00:58:19.760
Ross isn't just gonna let you
guys have your old rooms back.

00:58:21.268 --> 00:58:23.978
I know somewhere.

00:58:37.686 --> 00:58:40.527
The Kingsguard and the Dora
Milaje have been alerted.

00:58:40.552 --> 00:58:42.371
And the Border Tribe?

00:58:42.396 --> 00:58:43.840
Those that are left.

00:58:43.865 --> 00:58:46.583
Send word to the
Jabari as well.

00:58:46.623 --> 00:58:49.185
M'Baku likes a good fight.

00:58:50.568 --> 00:58:52.966
And what of this one?

00:58:53.215 --> 00:58:55.746
This one may be tired of war.

00:58:55.771 --> 00:58:59.692
But the White Wolf has
rested long enough.

00:59:21.517 --> 00:59:23.267
Where's the fight?

00:59:23.947 --> 00:59:25.735
On its way.

00:59:43.888 --> 00:59:47.395
In all the time I
have served Thanos...

00:59:48.322 --> 00:59:50.798
I have never failed him.

00:59:55.101 --> 00:59:58.499
If I were to reach our
rendezvous on Titan,

00:59:58.524 --> 01:00:02.281
with the Time Stone still attached
to your vaguely irritating person...

01:00:02.306 --> 01:00:05.188
There would be judgment.

01:00:13.629 --> 01:00:15.550
Give me...

01:00:19.396 --> 01:00:21.363
the Stone.

01:00:32.718 --> 01:00:35.655
Wow. You are a seriously
loyal piece of hardware.

01:00:35.671 --> 01:00:37.772
Speaking of loyalty...

01:00:38.132 --> 01:00:40.864
- I know what you're gonna say to me.
- You should not be here.

01:00:40.889 --> 01:00:41.889
- I was gonna go home.
- I don't wanna hear it!

01:00:41.905 --> 01:00:44.603
But it was such a long way
down and I just thought about...

01:00:44.615 --> 01:00:45.795
And now I gotta hear it.

01:00:45.819 --> 01:00:48.951
And this suit is, ridiculously
intuitive, by the way.

01:00:48.965 --> 01:00:52.076
So, if anything, its kind of
your fault that I'm here.

01:00:52.101 --> 01:00:53.702
- What did you just say?
- I take that back.

01:00:53.718 --> 01:00:55.265
And now I'm here in space.

01:00:55.277 --> 01:00:57.839
Yeah. Right where I
didn't want you to be.

01:00:57.886 --> 01:01:00.137
This isn't Coney Island,
or some field trip.

01:01:00.149 --> 01:01:02.261
This is a one-way ticket.
Do you hear me?

01:01:02.285 --> 01:01:05.529
- Don't pretend you thought this through.
- I did think this through.

01:01:05.554 --> 01:01:09.866
You can't be a friendly neighborhood
Spider-Man if there's no neighborhood.

01:01:11.218 --> 01:01:14.764
Okay, that didn't make sense but
you know what I'm trying to say.

01:01:16.419 --> 01:01:19.462
Come on. We got a situation.

01:01:19.614 --> 01:01:23.145
See him down there? He's in trouble.
What's your plan? Go.

01:01:23.669 --> 01:01:25.496
Okay, okay.

01:01:25.809 --> 01:01:28.637
OK, you ever see this
really old movie Aliens?

01:01:32.105 --> 01:01:34.824
Painful, aren't they?

01:01:35.229 --> 01:01:38.644
They were originally
designed for microsurgery.

01:01:38.768 --> 01:01:40.986
And any one of them...

01:01:45.416 --> 01:01:48.462
I could end your friend's
life in an instant.

01:01:48.494 --> 01:01:50.611
I gotta tell you, he's
not really my friend.

01:01:50.619 --> 01:01:54.220
Saving his life is more of
a professional courtesy.

01:01:54.939 --> 01:01:56.791
You've saved nothing.

01:01:57.752 --> 01:02:01.345
Your powers are inconsequential
compared to mine.

01:02:01.361 --> 01:02:04.017
Yeah, but the kid's
seen more movies.

01:02:16.294 --> 01:02:17.926
Yes!

01:02:18.386 --> 01:02:20.449
Wait, what are those?

01:02:34.859 --> 01:02:37.234
Hey, we haven't officially met.

01:02:37.937 --> 01:02:39.070
Cool.

01:02:40.624 --> 01:02:44.483
- We gotta turn this ship around.
- Yeah. Now he wants to run.

01:02:44.499 --> 01:02:46.313
Great, I want to protect the stone.

01:02:46.338 --> 01:02:49.111
And I want you to thank me now.
Go ahead, I'm listening.

01:02:49.127 --> 01:02:52.095
For what? Nearly
blasting me to space?

01:02:52.104 --> 01:02:54.884
Who just saved your magical ass?
Me.

01:02:54.893 --> 01:02:57.136
I seriously don't know how you
fit your head into that helmet.

01:02:57.160 --> 01:02:59.479
Admit it. You should've ducked
out when I told you to.

01:02:59.487 --> 01:03:01.307
I tried to bench
you, you refused.

01:03:01.332 --> 01:03:03.565
Unlike everyone else in your
life, I don't work for you.

01:03:03.590 --> 01:03:06.108
And due to that fact,
we're now in a flying doughnut,

01:03:06.308 --> 01:03:07.461
billions of miles from Earth,

01:03:07.521 --> 01:03:08.685
- with no back-up.
- I'm back-up!

01:03:08.710 --> 01:03:11.688
No. You're a stowaway.
The adults are talking.

01:03:11.713 --> 01:03:15.954
I'm confused as to the relationship
here, I mean, what is he? Your ward?

01:03:15.979 --> 01:03:19.689
- No. I'm Peter, by the way.
- Doctor Strange.

01:03:19.714 --> 01:03:22.135
Oh, we're using our
made-up names.

01:03:22.160 --> 01:03:23.972
I'm Spider-Man, then.

01:03:24.191 --> 01:03:26.949
The ship is self-correcting its course.
Thing's on autopilot.

01:03:26.974 --> 01:03:30.558
Can we control it? Fly us home?

01:03:33.883 --> 01:03:34.906
- Stark.
- Yeah?

01:03:34.930 --> 01:03:37.711
- Can you get us home?
- Yeah. Heard you.

01:03:38.961 --> 01:03:41.992
I'm not so sure we should.

01:03:42.102 --> 01:03:46.296
Under no circumstances can we
bring the Time Stone to Thanos.

01:03:46.367 --> 01:03:48.929
I don't think you quite
understand what's at stake here.

01:03:48.954 --> 01:03:51.288
No. It's you who doesn't
understand that

01:03:51.300 --> 01:03:53.875
Thanos has been inside
my head for six years

01:03:53.907 --> 01:03:57.250
since he sent an army to New
York, and now he's back!

01:03:57.275 --> 01:03:59.345
And I don't know what to do.

01:03:59.504 --> 01:04:02.981
So I'm not so sure if it's a better
plan to fight him on our turf or his.

01:04:03.006 --> 01:04:06.435
But you saw. What they
did, what they can do.

01:04:06.556 --> 01:04:09.087
At least, let's hope
he's not expecting it.

01:04:09.123 --> 01:04:13.195
So I say we take the
fight to him, Doctor.

01:04:14.553 --> 01:04:16.685
Do you concur?

01:04:18.703 --> 01:04:21.945
All right, Stark. We go to him.

01:04:22.211 --> 01:04:24.398
But you have to understand...

01:04:24.571 --> 01:04:29.071
If it comes to saving you, the
kid, or the Time Stone...

01:04:29.126 --> 01:04:32.721
I will not hesitate to
let either of you die.

01:04:32.746 --> 01:04:36.902
I can't. Because the
universe depends on it.

01:04:36.927 --> 01:04:40.403
Nice. Good. Moral compass.

01:04:43.253 --> 01:04:45.971
All right, kid...

01:04:46.855 --> 01:04:49.470
You're an Avenger now.

01:05:24.068 --> 01:05:26.771
I thought you might be hungry.

01:05:38.491 --> 01:05:40.732
I always hated that chair.

01:05:40.747 --> 01:05:42.545
So I've been told.

01:05:42.821 --> 01:05:47.196
Even so, I hoped you'd
sit in it one day.

01:05:47.629 --> 01:05:51.410
I hated this room, this ship...

01:05:51.556 --> 01:05:54.220
I hated my life.

01:05:57.469 --> 01:06:00.217
You told me that, too.

01:06:03.116 --> 01:06:05.358
Everyday.

01:06:07.323 --> 01:06:10.041
For almost twenty years.

01:06:11.546 --> 01:06:14.022
I was a child when you took me.

01:06:15.169 --> 01:06:17.544
I saved you.

01:06:20.013 --> 01:06:26.049
No. We were happy
on my home planet.

01:06:26.097 --> 01:06:29.963
Going to bed hungry?
Scrounging for scraps?

01:06:29.988 --> 01:06:34.878
Your planet was on the brink of collapse.
I'm the one who stopped that.

01:06:35.314 --> 01:06:37.478
You know what's happened since then?

01:06:37.511 --> 01:06:41.550
The children born, have
known nothing but full

01:06:41.562 --> 01:06:45.182
bellies and clear skies.
It's a paradise.

01:06:46.762 --> 01:06:49.176
Because you murdered
half the planet.

01:06:49.201 --> 01:06:51.982
A small price to
pay for salvation.

01:06:52.099 --> 01:06:55.396
- You're insane.
- Little one, it's a simple calculus.

01:06:55.421 --> 01:06:58.631
This universe is finite.
Its resources, finite.

01:06:58.656 --> 01:07:02.890
If life is left unchecked,
life will cease to exist.

01:07:03.161 --> 01:07:07.153
- It needs correction.
- You don't know that!

01:07:07.325 --> 01:07:10.200
I'm the only one who knows that.

01:07:10.208 --> 01:07:14.895
At least, I'm the only one
with the will to act on it.

01:07:16.170 --> 01:07:18.841
For a time...

01:07:19.545 --> 01:07:20.685
You...

01:07:21.974 --> 01:07:24.200
had that same will,

01:07:25.440 --> 01:07:29.873
as you fought by my side,
daughter.

01:07:30.509 --> 01:07:33.266
I'm not your daughter.

01:07:34.689 --> 01:07:37.946
Everything I hated about
myself, you taught me.

01:07:38.150 --> 01:07:42.238
And in doing so, made you the
fiercest woman in the galaxy.

01:07:44.821 --> 01:07:48.438
It's why I trusted you
to find the Soul Stone.

01:07:51.001 --> 01:07:54.461
I'm sorry I disappointed you.

01:07:54.946 --> 01:07:56.946
I am disappointed.

01:07:57.146 --> 01:07:59.993
But not because
you didn't find it.

01:08:03.810 --> 01:08:06.349
But because you did.

01:08:06.921 --> 01:08:09.145
And you lied.

01:08:25.798 --> 01:08:27.501
Nebula!

01:08:34.062 --> 01:08:35.578
Don't do this.

01:08:35.706 --> 01:08:40.010
Sometime ago, your sister snuck
aboard this ship to kill me.

01:08:40.035 --> 01:08:43.440
- Please, don't do this.
- She very nearly succeeded.

01:08:43.938 --> 01:08:48.625
So, I brought her here...
to talk.

01:08:55.503 --> 01:08:58.643
Stop. Stop it.

01:09:03.924 --> 01:09:06.525
I swear to you, on my life...

01:09:06.600 --> 01:09:10.452
I never found the Soul Stone.

01:09:13.253 --> 01:09:14.784
Accessing memory files.

01:09:14.809 --> 01:09:16.652
You know what he's about to do.

01:09:16.668 --> 01:09:19.730
He's finally ready, and he's going
for the stones. All of them.

01:09:19.739 --> 01:09:23.840
He'll never get them all.
He can't, Nebula.

01:09:23.865 --> 01:09:27.958
Because I found the map to the Soul
Stone, and I burned it to ash.

01:09:27.991 --> 01:09:30.639
I burned it.

01:09:34.108 --> 01:09:36.928
You're strong.

01:09:37.748 --> 01:09:39.787
Me...

01:09:41.639 --> 01:09:45.443
The generous... me...

01:09:47.462 --> 01:09:50.118
But I never taught you to lie.

01:09:50.134 --> 01:09:53.055
That's why you're so bad at it.

01:09:54.837 --> 01:09:59.243
Where is the Soul Stone?

01:10:16.657 --> 01:10:18.578
Vormir.

01:10:35.840 --> 01:10:38.043
The stone is on Vormir.

01:10:40.653 --> 01:10:43.574
Show me.

01:10:45.059 --> 01:10:46.285
I am Groot.

01:10:46.485 --> 01:10:48.703
Tinkle in the cup.
We're not looking for...

01:10:48.903 --> 01:10:51.410
What's a twig?
Everybody's seen a twig.

01:10:51.414 --> 01:10:52.671
I am Groot!

01:10:52.771 --> 01:10:54.438
You can pour what's
in the cup out in space

01:10:54.463 --> 01:10:55.695
then go in the cup again.

01:10:55.720 --> 01:10:56.855
You speak Groot?

01:10:57.055 --> 01:10:58.993
Yes, the tone on Asgard,
that was an elective.

01:10:59.009 --> 01:11:02.118
- I am Groot.
- You'll know when we're close.

01:11:02.122 --> 01:11:06.825
Nivadellir's forge harnesses the
blazing power of the Neutron star.

01:11:09.253 --> 01:11:10.955
It's the birthplace of my hammer.

01:11:11.907 --> 01:11:13.317
It's truly awesome.

01:11:19.614 --> 01:11:22.958
Okay. Time to be the captain.

01:11:27.863 --> 01:11:31.831
So dead brother, huh? Yeah,
that could be annoying.

01:11:32.254 --> 01:11:35.356
Well, he's been dead before.

01:11:35.395 --> 01:11:38.715
Now this time, I think
it really might be true.

01:11:38.723 --> 01:11:42.621
- And you said your sister and your dad...
- Both dead.

01:11:42.952 --> 01:11:46.616
- But still got a mom, though?
- Killed by a Dark Elf.

01:11:46.663 --> 01:11:50.342
- A best friend?
- Stabbed through the heart.

01:11:52.512 --> 01:11:56.152
You sure you're up to
this particular mission?

01:11:57.945 --> 01:11:59.305
Absolutely!

01:11:59.505 --> 01:12:02.265
The rage and vengeance, anger...

01:12:02.273 --> 01:12:05.172
Loss, regret, they're all
tremendous motivators.

01:12:05.184 --> 01:12:07.976
They really clear the
mind, so I'm good to go.

01:12:08.164 --> 01:12:11.094
Yeah, but this Thanos
we're talking about,

01:12:11.294 --> 01:12:13.117
he's the toughest there is.

01:12:13.142 --> 01:12:15.337
- Well, he's never fought me.
- Yeah, he has.

01:12:15.362 --> 01:12:17.009
He's never fought me twice.

01:12:17.340 --> 01:12:19.908
I'm getting a new
hammer, don't forget.

01:12:19.933 --> 01:12:22.683
It better be some hammer.

01:12:26.086 --> 01:12:29.171
You know, I'm 1,500 years old.

01:12:29.195 --> 01:12:31.309
I've killed twice as many
enemies as that, and

01:12:31.321 --> 01:12:33.312
every one of them
would've rather killed me

01:12:33.337 --> 01:12:34.962
but none succeeded.

01:12:34.987 --> 01:12:37.955
I'm only alive because
fate wants me alive.

01:12:37.976 --> 01:12:41.149
Thanos is just the, latest
in a long line of bastards

01:12:41.174 --> 01:12:45.358
and he will be the latest to feel
my vengeance. Fate wills it so.

01:12:46.352 --> 01:12:49.195
And what if you're wrong?

01:12:51.617 --> 01:12:54.132
Well, if I'm wrong, then...

01:12:54.514 --> 01:12:57.952
What more could I lose?

01:13:09.350 --> 01:13:13.810
I could lose a lot. Me
personally, I could lose a lot.

01:13:17.445 --> 01:13:19.007
Okay.

01:13:19.929 --> 01:13:23.732
Well, if fate does want you
to kill that crapsack,

01:13:23.757 --> 01:13:26.296
- you need more than one stupid eyeball.
- What's this?

01:13:26.321 --> 01:13:27.457
What's it look like?

01:13:27.880 --> 01:13:30.735
Some jerk lost a bet
with me in Contraxia.

01:13:30.743 --> 01:13:33.164
- He gave you his eye?
- No, he gave me 100 credits.

01:13:33.188 --> 01:13:36.711
I snuck into his room later
that night and stole his eye.

01:13:37.977 --> 01:13:40.805
Thank you, sweet rabbit.

01:13:47.439 --> 01:13:49.877
I would've washed that.

01:13:49.902 --> 01:13:52.923
The only way I could sneak it
off Contraxia was on my...

01:13:53.435 --> 01:13:55.128
Hey, we're here.

01:13:59.321 --> 01:14:02.813
I don't think this thing works.
Everything seems dark.

01:14:03.950 --> 01:14:06.520
But it ain't the eye.

01:14:19.075 --> 01:14:23.856
Something's wrong.
The star's gone out.

01:14:23.887 --> 01:14:27.410
And the rings are frozen.

01:14:46.346 --> 01:14:50.673
I hope these dwarfs are better at
forging than they are at cleaning.

01:14:54.883 --> 01:14:58.374
Maybe they realized they live in a
junk pile in the middle of space.

01:14:58.390 --> 01:15:01.812
The forge hasn't gone
dark in centuries.

01:15:03.430 --> 01:15:07.679
- You said Thanos had a gauntlet, right?
- Yes. Why?

01:15:07.695 --> 01:15:10.726
Did it look anything like that?

01:15:13.015 --> 01:15:17.327
- I am Groot.
- Get back to the pod.

01:15:20.764 --> 01:15:23.912
Eitri, wait! Stop!

01:15:26.471 --> 01:15:27.963
Thor?

01:15:30.263 --> 01:15:35.247
- What happened here?
- You were supposed to protect us.

01:15:35.450 --> 01:15:41.342
- Asgard was supposed to protect us.
- Asgard is destroyed.

01:15:42.870 --> 01:15:46.745
Eitri, what did you do?

01:15:59.351 --> 01:16:03.296
300 dwarfs lived on this ring.

01:16:03.475 --> 01:16:07.069
I thought if I did what
he asked, they'd be safe.

01:16:09.100 --> 01:16:11.920
I made what he wanted.

01:16:12.257 --> 01:16:17.311
A device capable of harnessing
the power of the stones.

01:16:21.255 --> 01:16:24.184
And he killed everyone anyway.

01:16:25.966 --> 01:16:28.497
All except me.

01:16:28.621 --> 01:16:31.902
"Your life is yours," he said.

01:16:31.927 --> 01:16:36.661
"But your hands. Your
hands are mine alone."

01:16:36.739 --> 01:16:39.450
Eitri, this isn't
about your hands.

01:16:39.770 --> 01:16:41.669
Every weapon you've
ever designed,

01:16:41.694 --> 01:16:45.849
every axe, hammer, sword,
it's all inside your head.

01:16:46.200 --> 01:16:49.989
Now I know it feels like all hope is lost.
Trust me, I know.

01:16:50.278 --> 01:16:56.177
But together, you and
I, we can kill Thanos.

01:17:35.450 --> 01:17:38.035
Mantis, listen very carefully.

01:17:38.044 --> 01:17:40.825
I need you to meet me on Titan.

01:17:46.876 --> 01:17:49.399
- What's going on?
- I think we're here.

01:17:49.424 --> 01:17:52.400
I don't think this rig has
a self-park function.

01:17:53.267 --> 01:17:55.915
Get your hand inside this.

01:17:57.696 --> 01:18:01.961
Then, we got one big dodge, so we
gotta move at the same time.

01:18:06.728 --> 01:18:10.735
We might wanna turn, turn, turn.
Turn!

01:18:38.711 --> 01:18:40.734
You all right?

01:18:41.930 --> 01:18:44.523
That was close.

01:18:44.719 --> 01:18:46.562
I owe you one.

01:18:46.594 --> 01:18:50.906
Let me just say, if aliens wind up
implanting eggs in my chest or something,

01:18:50.944 --> 01:18:53.609
- and I eat one of you, I'm sorry.
- I don't want another single,

01:18:53.634 --> 01:18:55.914
pop-culture reference outta you for
the rest of the trip. Understand?

01:18:55.938 --> 01:18:58.336
I'm trying to say that,
something is coming.

01:19:04.614 --> 01:19:06.442
Thanos!

01:19:26.517 --> 01:19:29.329
Oh, my God! Please don't
put your eggs in me!

01:19:37.712 --> 01:19:40.821
Die, Blanket of Death!

01:19:45.696 --> 01:19:49.336
Everybody stay where you
are, chill the F out...

01:19:49.954 --> 01:19:52.633
I'm gonna ask you
this one time...

01:19:52.658 --> 01:19:54.014
Where is Gamora?

01:19:54.039 --> 01:19:56.773
Yeah, I'll do you one better.
Who's Gamora?

01:19:56.798 --> 01:20:00.015
I'll do you one better!
Why is Gamora?

01:20:00.040 --> 01:20:03.038
Let him go, or I swear to you, I'm
gonna french fry this little freak.

01:20:03.063 --> 01:20:06.705
Let's do it. You shoot my guy and
I'll blast him. Let's go!

01:20:06.804 --> 01:20:10.395
- Do it, Quill. I can take it.
- No, he can't take it.

01:20:10.420 --> 01:20:11.379
She's right. You can't.

01:20:11.479 --> 01:20:13.233
Oh yeah? You don't wanna
tell me where she is?

01:20:13.257 --> 01:20:17.171
That's fine. I'll kill all three of you
and I'll beat it out of Thanos myself!

01:20:17.196 --> 01:20:19.530
- Starting with you.
- Wait what, Thanos? All right...

01:20:19.546 --> 01:20:21.772
Let me ask you this one time...

01:20:21.797 --> 01:20:23.898
What master do you serve?

01:20:23.922 --> 01:20:27.322
What master do I serve? Am
I supposed to say Jesus?

01:20:27.399 --> 01:20:29.588
- You're from Earth.
- Not from Earth. I'm from Missouri.

01:20:29.612 --> 01:20:32.197
Yeah, that's on Earth, dipshit.
What are you hassling us for?

01:20:32.222 --> 01:20:36.791
- So you're not with Thanos?
- With Thanos?

01:20:36.915 --> 01:20:39.664
No! I'm here to kill Thanos.

01:20:39.696 --> 01:20:41.491
He took my girl. Wait, who are you?

01:20:42.083 --> 01:20:43.796
We're the Avengers, man.

01:20:43.996 --> 01:20:47.518
- You're the ones Thor told us about!
- You know Thor?

01:20:47.892 --> 01:20:51.610
Yeah. Tall guy, not
that good-looking.

01:20:51.774 --> 01:20:54.617
Where is he now?

01:21:08.257 --> 01:21:10.149
This the plan? We'll
hit him with a brick?

01:21:10.252 --> 01:21:11.968
It's a mold.

01:21:12.598 --> 01:21:16.919
A king's weapon. Meant to
be the greatest in Asgard.

01:21:17.513 --> 01:21:19.831
In theory, it could
even summon the Bifrost.

01:21:20.092 --> 01:21:21.771
Does it have a name?

01:21:23.056 --> 01:21:24.374
Storm breaker.

01:21:24.539 --> 01:21:27.587
Yeah. It's a bit much.

01:21:27.916 --> 01:21:30.236
So how do we make it?

01:21:30.997 --> 01:21:32.830
You'll have to restart the forge.

01:21:34.288 --> 01:21:37.567
Awaken the heart of the dying star.

01:21:38.908 --> 01:21:42.868
Rabbit, fire up the pod.

01:21:44.673 --> 01:21:47.212
What the hell happened
to this planet?

01:21:47.237 --> 01:21:48.998
It's 8 degrees off its axis.

01:21:49.089 --> 01:21:52.002
Gravitational pull is
all over the place.

01:21:52.673 --> 01:21:56.360
Yeah, we got one advantage.
He's coming to us.

01:21:56.400 --> 01:21:59.383
We'll use it. Alright,
I have a plan.

01:22:00.631 --> 01:22:03.271
It's pretty simple. We draw him in,
pin him down, get what we need.

01:22:03.478 --> 01:22:06.977
We definitely don't want to dance with
this guy, we just want the gauntlet.

01:22:07.002 --> 01:22:08.348
Are you yawning?

01:22:09.453 --> 01:22:11.633
In the middle of this,
while I'm breaking it down?

01:22:11.658 --> 01:22:13.369
Did you hear what I said?

01:22:13.455 --> 01:22:16.080
I stopped listening after you
said that we need a plan.

01:22:16.088 --> 01:22:17.113
Okay, Mr. Clean's
on his own page.

01:22:17.204 --> 01:22:19.611
See, not winging it isn't
really what they do.

01:22:19.636 --> 01:22:21.807
What exactly is it that they do?

01:22:21.832 --> 01:22:25.003
Kick names, take ass.

01:22:31.361 --> 01:22:32.926
All right, just get over here, please?

01:22:33.475 --> 01:22:35.792
Mr. Lord,
can you get your folks to circle up?

01:22:35.817 --> 01:22:39.004
Star-Lord is fine.

01:22:40.162 --> 01:22:41.339
We've gotta coalesce.

01:22:41.539 --> 01:22:43.412
Because if all we come at him
with is a plucky attitude...

01:22:43.420 --> 01:22:47.435
Dude, don't call us plucky.
We don't know what it means.

01:22:47.451 --> 01:22:51.310
All right, we're optimistic, yes.
I like your plan, except it sucks.

01:22:51.335 --> 01:22:54.749
So let me do the plan, and that
way, it might be really good.

01:22:54.774 --> 01:22:56.804
Tell him about the dance-off
to save the Universe.

01:22:56.816 --> 01:22:57.873
What dance-off?

01:22:57.973 --> 01:23:00.618
- It's not a, it's not a...
- Like in Footloose? The movie?

01:23:00.642 --> 01:23:04.321
Exactly like Footloose! Is it still
the greatest movie in history?

01:23:04.346 --> 01:23:06.064
It never was.

01:23:06.713 --> 01:23:09.494
- We're getting no help with Flash Gordon.
- Flash Gordon?

01:23:09.519 --> 01:23:12.128
By the way? That's a compliment.
Don't forget.

01:23:12.159 --> 01:23:15.260
I'm half-human. So that's
50% of me that's stupid,

01:23:15.462 --> 01:23:18.415
- And that's 100% you.
- Your math is blowing my mind.

01:23:18.456 --> 01:23:19.868
Excuse me?

01:23:20.525 --> 01:23:24.712
But does your friend
often do that?

01:23:25.181 --> 01:23:28.196
Strange! You all right?

01:23:37.731 --> 01:23:41.301
- You're back. You're all right.
- Hey, what was that?

01:23:41.326 --> 01:23:45.482
I went forward in time, to
view alternate futures...

01:23:45.787 --> 01:23:49.662
To see all the possible
outcomes of the coming conflict.

01:23:49.896 --> 01:23:53.771
- How many did you see?
- 14,000,605.

01:23:55.217 --> 01:23:58.037
How many did we win?

01:24:01.645 --> 01:24:03.137
One.

01:24:24.686 --> 01:24:27.944
The Stone had
better be up there.

01:24:29.460 --> 01:24:33.030
For your sister's sake.

01:24:52.406 --> 01:24:57.812
Welcome, Thanos, son of Eros.

01:24:59.164 --> 01:25:02.601
Gamora, daughter of Thanos.

01:25:02.725 --> 01:25:04.076
You know us?

01:25:04.108 --> 01:25:08.912
It is my curse to know
all who journey here.

01:25:08.999 --> 01:25:11.420
Where is the Soul Stone?

01:25:11.445 --> 01:25:13.554
You should know,

01:25:13.754 --> 01:25:17.226
it extracts a terrible price.

01:25:18.116 --> 01:25:20.686
I'm prepared.

01:25:22.350 --> 01:25:26.061
We all think that at first.

01:25:29.163 --> 01:25:32.178
We are all wrong.

01:25:42.949 --> 01:25:45.691
How is it you know
this place so well?

01:25:45.716 --> 01:25:50.309
A lifetime ago, I, too,
sought the stones.

01:25:50.341 --> 01:25:55.380
I even held one in my hand.
But it cast me out.

01:25:55.435 --> 01:25:57.653
Banished me here.

01:25:57.661 --> 01:26:01.911
Guiding others to a
treasure I cannot possess.

01:26:10.057 --> 01:26:13.689
What you seek lies
in front of you.

01:26:13.846 --> 01:26:17.048
As does what you fear.

01:26:17.174 --> 01:26:20.525
- What's this?
- The price.

01:26:20.611 --> 01:26:25.517
Soul holds a special place
among the Infinity Stones.

01:26:26.178 --> 01:26:30.814
You might say it is,
a certain wisdom.

01:26:31.849 --> 01:26:33.589
Tell me what it needs.

01:26:34.098 --> 01:26:37.357
To ensure
whoever possesses it,

01:26:37.404 --> 01:26:40.865
understands its power...

01:26:40.904 --> 01:26:44.795
The Stone demands a sacrifice.

01:26:44.879 --> 01:26:46.419
Of what?

01:26:46.619 --> 01:26:48.738
In order to take the Stone...

01:26:48.770 --> 01:26:52.105
You must lose that
which you love.

01:26:54.199 --> 01:26:58.738
A soul, for a soul.

01:27:13.202 --> 01:27:16.381
All my life, I
dreamed of a day...

01:27:16.436 --> 01:27:18.944
a moment...

01:27:19.181 --> 01:27:22.033
when you got
what you deserved.

01:27:23.204 --> 01:27:26.743
And I was always
so disappointed.

01:27:29.149 --> 01:27:31.281
But, now...

01:27:34.516 --> 01:27:37.961
You kill, and torture,

01:27:39.563 --> 01:27:42.726
and you call it mercy.

01:27:45.508 --> 01:27:48.539
The Universe has judged you.

01:27:49.475 --> 01:27:52.571
You asked it for a prize and

01:27:52.771 --> 01:27:54.982
and it told you, no.

01:27:55.553 --> 01:27:57.810
You failed.

01:27:58.366 --> 01:28:00.975
And do you wanna know why?

01:28:01.209 --> 01:28:03.189
Because you love nothing.

01:28:03.825 --> 01:28:05.250
No one.

01:28:16.422 --> 01:28:20.562
Really? Tears?

01:28:20.719 --> 01:28:23.109
They are not for him.

01:28:36.816 --> 01:28:38.894
No.

01:28:39.401 --> 01:28:42.041
This isn't love.

01:28:42.066 --> 01:28:45.550
I ignored my destiny once.

01:28:46.808 --> 01:28:49.082
I cannot do that again.

01:28:49.737 --> 01:28:51.426
Even...

01:28:51.686 --> 01:28:53.684
for you.

01:29:17.146 --> 01:29:19.997
I'm sorry, little one.

01:31:01.373 --> 01:31:04.748
Drop to 2,600. Heading 030.

01:31:04.818 --> 01:31:06.573
I hope you're right about this,

01:31:06.595 --> 01:31:09.662
or we're gonna land a lot
faster than you want to.

01:31:25.040 --> 01:31:27.702
When you sad we were going
to open Wakanda to the

01:31:27.714 --> 01:31:30.282
rest of the world, this
is not what I imagined.

01:31:30.290 --> 01:31:32.266
What did you imagine?

01:31:32.291 --> 01:31:36.047
The Olympics. Even a Starbucks.

01:31:49.594 --> 01:31:52.922
- Should we bow?
- Yeah, he's a king.

01:31:52.953 --> 01:31:56.078
Seems like I'm always
thanking you for something.

01:31:56.757 --> 01:32:00.632
- What are you doing?
- We don't do that here.

01:32:00.657 --> 01:32:03.229
So how big of an assault
should we expect?

01:32:03.241 --> 01:32:05.883
Sir, I think you should expect
quite a big assault.

01:32:05.899 --> 01:32:08.664
- How are we looking?
- You will have my Kingsguard.

01:32:08.704 --> 01:32:12.578
The Border Tribe, the Dora Milaje.
And...

01:32:12.938 --> 01:32:16.547
A semi-stable 100-year old man.

01:32:18.665 --> 01:32:20.344
How have you been, Buck?

01:32:20.369 --> 01:32:23.833
Not bad, for the
end of the world.

01:32:36.410 --> 01:32:38.980
The structure is polymorphic.

01:32:39.019 --> 01:32:42.183
Right. We had to attach each
neuron non-sequentially.

01:32:42.199 --> 01:32:47.269
Why didn't you just reprogram the
synapses to work collectively?

01:32:47.378 --> 01:32:51.073
Because... we didn't think of it?

01:32:51.089 --> 01:32:54.456
- I'm sure you did your best.
- Can you do it?

01:32:54.635 --> 01:32:58.017
Yes, but there are more than
2 trillion neurons here.

01:32:58.057 --> 01:33:01.681
One misalignment could cause a
cascade of circuit failures.

01:33:01.752 --> 01:33:05.353
- It will take time, brother.
- How long?

01:33:05.378 --> 01:33:08.424
As long as you can give me.

01:33:11.464 --> 01:33:15.846
Something's entered
the atmosphere.

01:33:30.388 --> 01:33:32.950
Hey Cap, we got a
situation here.

01:33:42.123 --> 01:33:44.568
God, I love this place.

01:33:44.584 --> 01:33:49.239
Don't start celebrating yet, guys. We
got more incoming outside the dome.

01:34:07.233 --> 01:34:10.938
It's too late. We need to
destroy the Stone now.

01:34:10.963 --> 01:34:14.563
- Vision, get your ass back on the table.
- We will hold them off.

01:34:14.565 --> 01:34:19.314
Wanda, as soon as that stone's out
of his head, you blow it to hell.

01:34:19.339 --> 01:34:20.408
I will.

01:34:20.455 --> 01:34:24.009
Evacuate the city,
engage all defenses...

01:34:24.026 --> 01:34:27.517
and get this man a shield!

01:34:35.905 --> 01:34:38.539
I don't think you get
the scientifics here.

01:34:38.564 --> 01:34:41.354
These rings are gigantic.
You wanna get them moving,

01:34:41.366 --> 01:34:43.798
you need something bigger
to yank them loose!

01:34:43.814 --> 01:34:45.931
- Leave that to me.
- Leave it to you?

01:34:45.939 --> 01:34:49.993
Buddy, you're in space. All
you got is a wrong plan...

01:34:57.423 --> 01:34:59.992
Fire the engines!

01:35:15.949 --> 01:35:19.425
More power, rabbit!

01:35:50.112 --> 01:35:52.572
Well done, boy.

01:35:53.206 --> 01:35:56.995
That's Nidavellir!

01:36:15.772 --> 01:36:18.818
- Damn it.
- What's damn it?

01:36:18.843 --> 01:36:20.905
- The mechanism is crippled.
- What?

01:36:20.920 --> 01:36:23.142
With the iris closed, I
can't heat the metal.

01:36:23.167 --> 01:36:27.182
- How long will it take to heat it?
- A few minutes, maybe more. Why?

01:36:29.095 --> 01:36:31.759
- I'm gonna hold it open.
- That's suicide.

01:36:31.784 --> 01:36:34.901
So is facing Thanos
without that axe.

01:36:43.661 --> 01:36:47.676
- How are we looking, Bruce?
- Yeah, I think I'm getting the hang of it.

01:36:50.073 --> 01:36:54.979
It's so amazing! It's like being
the Hulk without actually...

01:36:57.802 --> 01:36:59.583
I'm okay.

01:37:01.309 --> 01:37:05.043
I got two heat signatures
breaking through the treeline.

01:37:31.976 --> 01:37:34.452
Thank you for standing with us.

01:37:34.484 --> 01:37:36.468
Of course, brother.

01:37:56.159 --> 01:37:58.596
Where's the other friend?

01:37:58.620 --> 01:38:01.479
He will pay for his
life with yours.

01:38:01.893 --> 01:38:04.744
Thanos will have that stone.

01:38:04.815 --> 01:38:06.282
That's not gonna happen.

01:38:06.307 --> 01:38:08.838
You are in Wakanda now.

01:38:08.878 --> 01:38:13.377
Thanos will have nothing
but dust, and blood.

01:38:13.503 --> 01:38:15.177
We,

01:38:15.377 --> 01:38:18.127
have blood to spare.

01:38:28.877 --> 01:38:33.103
- They surrender?
- Not exactly.

01:38:43.124 --> 01:38:45.959
- Yibambe!
- Yibambe!

01:38:46.085 --> 01:38:47.762
Yibambe!

01:38:59.105 --> 01:39:01.893
What the hell?

01:39:03.611 --> 01:39:06.345
Looks like we pissed her off.

01:39:16.276 --> 01:39:18.924
They're killing themselves.

01:39:54.104 --> 01:39:55.617
See the teeth on those things?

01:39:55.629 --> 01:39:58.346
Alright, back up, Sam. They
ain't get your wings yet.

01:40:10.201 --> 01:40:12.757
Cap, if these things circle the
perimeter and get in behind us,

01:40:12.926 --> 01:40:14.677
there's nothing between
them and Vision.

01:40:14.877 --> 01:40:16.803
Then we better keep
them in front of us.

01:40:16.828 --> 01:40:19.224
How do we do that?

01:40:20.472 --> 01:40:22.660
We open the barrier.

01:40:24.272 --> 01:40:28.718
On my signal, open
northwest section 17.

01:40:28.766 --> 01:40:31.045
<i>Requesting confirmation, my King.</i>

01:40:31.055 --> 01:40:32.937
<i>You said open the barrier?</i>

01:40:32.946 --> 01:40:36.578
- On my signal.
- This will be the end of Wakanda.

01:40:37.172 --> 01:40:41.554
Then it will be the noblest
ending in history.

01:40:53.672 --> 01:40:57.609
- Wakanda forever!
- Wakanda forever!

01:41:07.859 --> 01:41:08.902
Now!

01:41:39.192 --> 01:41:42.165
- How much longer, Shuri?
- We've barely begun, brother.

01:41:42.323 --> 01:41:44.915
You might want to
pick up the pace.

01:41:51.183 --> 01:41:53.300
All fathers, give me strength.

01:41:53.325 --> 01:41:54.702
You understand, boy?

01:41:55.017 --> 01:41:58.450
You're about to take the
full force of a star.

01:41:59.106 --> 01:42:01.106
It'll kill you.

01:42:01.325 --> 01:42:03.817
And if I die?

01:42:03.856 --> 01:42:08.895
Yes, that's what,
killing you means.

01:42:35.806 --> 01:42:38.595
Hold it, hold it, Thor!

01:43:27.988 --> 01:43:31.081
Thor? Say something, come on.

01:43:31.340 --> 01:43:34.034
Thor, you okay?

01:43:37.550 --> 01:43:41.885
- I think he's dying.
- He needs the axe.

01:43:42.619 --> 01:43:45.337
Where's the handle?

01:43:46.939 --> 01:43:50.611
Tree! Help me find the handle.

01:44:58.254 --> 01:45:00.238
There's too many of them!

01:45:27.740 --> 01:45:30.436
You guys are so screwed now!

01:45:33.678 --> 01:45:36.904
Bring me Thanos!

01:46:08.381 --> 01:46:10.217
Oh, yeah.

01:46:12.836 --> 01:46:16.149
You're much more of a Thanos.

01:46:17.281 --> 01:46:20.289
I take it that Maw is dead?

01:46:21.390 --> 01:46:24.764
This day extracts a heavy toll.

01:46:25.906 --> 01:46:28.585
Still, he accomplished
his mission.

01:46:28.593 --> 01:46:30.131
You may regret that.

01:46:30.331 --> 01:46:34.382
He brought you face-to-face with
a Master of the Mystic Arts.

01:46:36.905 --> 01:46:40.038
Where do you think
he brought you?

01:46:40.082 --> 01:46:44.292
Let me guess.
Your home?

01:46:47.567 --> 01:46:49.466
It was.

01:46:51.466 --> 01:46:54.466
And it was beautiful.

01:46:55.458 --> 01:46:57.657
Titan was like most planets.

01:46:57.857 --> 01:47:00.966
Too many mouths,
not enough to go around.

01:47:00.989 --> 01:47:05.106
And when we faced extinction,
I offered a solution.

01:47:05.192 --> 01:47:07.356
Genocide?

01:47:07.381 --> 01:47:11.701
At random. Dispassionate, fair.
The rich and poor alike.

01:47:12.357 --> 01:47:15.177
And they called me a madman.

01:47:15.319 --> 01:47:19.521
And what I predicted,
came to pass.

01:47:20.507 --> 01:47:22.852
Congratulations. You're a prophet.

01:47:23.195 --> 01:47:24.585
I'm a survivor.

01:47:24.601 --> 01:47:27.030
Who wants to murder trillions.

01:47:27.109 --> 01:47:31.116
With all six Stones, I could
simply snap my fingers.

01:47:31.179 --> 01:47:36.314
They would all cease to exist.
I call that mercy.

01:47:37.666 --> 01:47:40.455
And then what?

01:47:40.744 --> 01:47:42.492
I finally rest.

01:47:42.692 --> 01:47:46.572
And watch the sun rise
on a grateful universe.

01:47:47.221 --> 01:47:51.439
The hardest choices require
the strongest wills.

01:47:51.729 --> 01:47:57.588
I think you'll find our
will equal to yours.

01:47:57.908 --> 01:47:59.837
"Our"?

01:48:04.780 --> 01:48:09.483
- Piece of cake, Quill.
- Yeah, if your goal was to piss him off!

01:48:46.829 --> 01:48:48.758
Boom!

01:48:49.227 --> 01:48:51.727
Don't let him close his fist.

01:48:55.313 --> 01:48:58.578
Magic! More magic!

01:48:58.813 --> 01:48:59.948
Magic with a kick!

01:49:00.270 --> 01:49:02.301
Magic with a...

01:49:02.542 --> 01:49:04.323
Insect.

01:49:41.471 --> 01:49:43.899
- Well, well.
- You should have killed me.

01:49:44.061 --> 01:49:47.209
Would have been a
waste of parts!

01:49:51.140 --> 01:49:53.687
Where's Gamora?

01:50:33.340 --> 01:50:34.800
Is he under? Don't let up.

01:50:34.825 --> 01:50:37.637
Be quick. He is very strong.

01:50:37.653 --> 01:50:41.562
Parker, help. Get over here. She
can't hold him much longer. Let's go.

01:50:48.811 --> 01:50:51.531
I thought you'd be harder to catch.
For the record, this was my plan.

01:50:52.449 --> 01:50:54.230
Not so strong now, huh?

01:50:54.668 --> 01:50:57.167
Where's Gamora?

01:50:57.362 --> 01:51:00.885
- My Gamora!
- Oh, bullshit!

01:51:00.917 --> 01:51:03.307
Where is she?

01:51:03.354 --> 01:51:06.580
- He is in anguish.
- Good.

01:51:07.486 --> 01:51:08.486
He...

01:51:08.511 --> 01:51:10.234
He mourns.

01:51:10.258 --> 01:51:14.633
What does this monster
have to mourn?

01:51:14.906 --> 01:51:16.867
Gamora...

01:51:19.453 --> 01:51:20.921
What?

01:51:20.945 --> 01:51:27.874
He took her to Vormir. He came back
with the Soul Stone. She didn't.

01:51:28.990 --> 01:51:32.997
Okay, Quill? You gotta cool
it right now, you understand?

01:51:33.466 --> 01:51:36.856
Don't. Don't engage.
We almost got this off!

01:51:37.989 --> 01:51:41.270
Tell me she's lying.

01:51:41.434 --> 01:51:44.864
Asshole! Tell me
you didn't do it.

01:51:45.918 --> 01:51:49.597
I had to...

01:51:49.799 --> 01:51:52.800
No you didn't.

01:51:55.753 --> 01:51:59.214
- No! No, you didn't!
- Quill!

01:51:59.363 --> 01:52:00.876
Just stop! Stop!

01:52:01.076 --> 01:52:04.441
It's coming, I got it, I got it!

01:52:07.259 --> 01:52:09.337
Oh, God.

01:53:07.423 --> 01:53:10.954
Come and get some, face-dogs!

01:53:13.048 --> 01:53:15.985
Come on! Get some, get some!

01:53:18.235 --> 01:53:21.008
- How much for the gun?
- Not for sale.

01:53:21.055 --> 01:53:23.758
Okay, how much for the arm?

01:53:24.649 --> 01:53:27.211
Oh, I'll get that arm.

01:53:35.522 --> 01:53:39.115
- New haircut?
- I notice you've copied my beard.

01:53:40.834 --> 01:53:43.279
Oh, by the way, this is a
friend of mine. A tree.

01:53:43.304 --> 01:53:45.858
I am Groot!

01:53:46.468 --> 01:53:48.858
I am Steve Rogers.

01:54:08.042 --> 01:54:11.033
Fall back! Fall back now!

01:54:19.398 --> 01:54:21.983
Focus all fire on the
left flank, Sam.

01:54:22.008 --> 01:54:24.124
I'm doing it.

01:54:46.793 --> 01:54:49.058
Why was she up there
all this time?

01:54:49.113 --> 01:54:52.574
She's on the field. Take it.

01:55:23.381 --> 01:55:26.818
Guys, we got a Vision
situation here.

01:55:28.717 --> 01:55:31.834
- Somebody get to Vision!
- I got him.

01:55:31.859 --> 01:55:33.366
On my way.

01:55:38.115 --> 01:55:41.052
He'll die alone. As will you.

01:55:41.060 --> 01:55:43.021
She's not alone.

01:56:08.412 --> 01:56:10.419
Oh, no. Oh, no, you don't.

01:56:10.444 --> 01:56:12.591
This isn't gonna be like
New York, pal. This

01:56:12.603 --> 01:56:14.858
suit's already kicked the
crap outta the Hulk.

01:56:19.282 --> 01:56:22.610
Guys. Vision needs back-up now.

01:56:23.820 --> 01:56:27.546
Hulk? I know you're not making your
entrance 'till the last second.

01:56:27.554 --> 01:56:31.585
This is it, man. This is
the last, last second.

01:56:34.741 --> 01:56:38.491
Hulk! Hulk!
Shit, Hulk!

01:56:39.085 --> 01:56:44.819
- No!
- Screw you, you big, green asshole!

01:56:44.827 --> 01:56:48.389
I'll do it myself. Come on.

01:57:01.064 --> 01:57:03.235
See ya!

01:57:13.863 --> 01:57:16.761
Hulk, we got a lot
to figure out, pal.

01:57:27.451 --> 01:57:29.771
I thought you were a formidable machine.

01:57:30.631 --> 01:57:33.281
But you're dying, like any man.

01:57:41.563 --> 01:57:43.648
Get outta here!

01:57:46.360 --> 01:57:48.289
Go!

01:58:05.844 --> 01:58:08.023
That's really gross.

01:58:34.611 --> 01:58:37.353
I thought I told you to go.

01:58:37.431 --> 01:58:40.126
We don't trade lives, Captain.

01:58:50.270 --> 01:58:52.973
I got you, I got you!

01:58:53.004 --> 01:58:55.754
Sorry I can't remember
any of your names.

01:59:40.179 --> 01:59:43.030
You're full of tricks, wizard.

01:59:43.523 --> 01:59:48.312
But you never once used
your greatest weapon.

01:59:49.822 --> 01:59:52.017
A fake.

01:59:58.971 --> 02:00:02.760
You throw another moon at
me, and I'm gonna lose it.

02:00:02.830 --> 02:00:05.252
- Stark.
- You know me?

02:00:05.728 --> 02:00:10.556
I do. You're not the only
one cursed with knowledge.

02:00:11.306 --> 02:00:13.454
My only curse is you.

02:00:43.910 --> 02:00:47.300
All that for a drop of blood.

02:01:29.965 --> 02:01:32.534
You have my respect, Stark.

02:01:33.496 --> 02:01:37.550
When I'm done, half of
humanity will still be alive.

02:01:42.245 --> 02:01:45.393
I hope they remember you.

02:01:54.395 --> 02:01:56.387
Stop.

02:02:01.778 --> 02:02:06.738
Spare his life, and I
will give you the Stone.

02:02:09.337 --> 02:02:11.852
No tricks.

02:02:15.610 --> 02:02:17.672
Don't!

02:03:08.133 --> 02:03:10.398
One to go.

02:03:19.624 --> 02:03:22.053
Where is he?

02:03:29.901 --> 02:03:33.002
Did we just lose?

02:03:35.339 --> 02:03:38.447
Why would you do that?

02:03:40.424 --> 02:03:43.822
We're in the endgame now.

02:04:08.572 --> 02:04:10.892
Are you okay?

02:04:11.814 --> 02:04:15.032
What? What is it?

02:04:16.087 --> 02:04:18.517
He's here.

02:04:28.454 --> 02:04:33.196
Everyone on my position.
We have incoming.

02:04:34.055 --> 02:04:37.086
What the hell?

02:05:02.227 --> 02:05:05.516
Cap. That's him.

02:05:07.015 --> 02:05:10.749
Eyes up. Stay sharp.

02:05:34.407 --> 02:05:37.485
Wanda. It's time.

02:05:37.524 --> 02:05:38.618
No.

02:05:38.818 --> 02:05:40.930
They can't stop him,
Wanda. But we can.

02:05:40.977 --> 02:05:44.212
Look at me. You have the
power to destroy the stone.

02:05:44.237 --> 02:05:47.125
- Don't.
- You must. Please...

02:05:48.292 --> 02:05:51.644
We are out of time.

02:05:51.669 --> 02:05:56.278
- I can't.
- Yes, you can. You can.

02:05:57.577 --> 02:06:01.608
If he gets this stone,
half the Universe dies.

02:06:02.139 --> 02:06:03.525
It's not fair.

02:06:04.979 --> 02:06:07.795
It shouldn't be you,
but it is.

02:06:08.522 --> 02:06:10.044
It's all right.

02:06:11.003 --> 02:06:13.717
You could never hurt me.

02:06:22.153 --> 02:06:25.504
I just feel you.

02:08:03.219 --> 02:08:05.429
I love you.

02:08:34.188 --> 02:08:36.984
I understand, my child.

02:08:37.665 --> 02:08:40.634
Better than anyone.

02:08:40.931 --> 02:08:43.290
You could never.

02:08:47.717 --> 02:08:51.599
Today, I lost more
than you can know.

02:08:52.443 --> 02:08:56.028
But now is no time to mourn.

02:08:57.295 --> 02:08:59.224
Now...

02:08:59.295 --> 02:09:02.865
is no time at all.

02:09:24.811 --> 02:09:27.576
No!

02:10:23.671 --> 02:10:26.233
I told you...

02:10:26.452 --> 02:10:30.178
You'd die for that.

02:10:42.949 --> 02:10:45.340
You should have...

02:10:47.003 --> 02:10:49.658
You...

02:10:50.768 --> 02:10:54.869
You should have
gone for the head!

02:10:56.254 --> 02:10:58.644
No!

02:11:30.329 --> 02:11:32.766
Daughter?

02:11:39.252 --> 02:11:41.494
Did you do it?

02:11:42.586 --> 02:11:44.992
Yes.

02:11:52.003 --> 02:11:54.901
What did it cost?

02:11:57.095 --> 02:12:00.220
Everything.

02:12:09.074 --> 02:12:11.042
What did you do?

02:12:11.972 --> 02:12:14.596
What did you do?!

02:12:27.050 --> 02:12:29.237
Where did he go?

02:12:31.628 --> 02:12:33.675
Thor...

02:12:35.738 --> 02:12:37.347
Where did he go?

02:12:37.449 --> 02:12:39.706
Steve?

02:13:13.415 --> 02:13:15.585
Up, General, up!

02:13:16.378 --> 02:13:17.914
This is no place to die.

02:13:32.856 --> 02:13:34.926
I am Groot...

02:13:34.950 --> 02:13:36.207
No.

02:13:37.020 --> 02:13:41.363
No. No. No. No! Groot...

02:13:41.651 --> 02:13:43.619
No...

02:13:56.099 --> 02:13:58.825
Sam?

02:14:01.357 --> 02:14:04.864
Sam, where you at?

02:14:12.204 --> 02:14:15.719
Something's happening...

02:14:26.499 --> 02:14:28.983
Quill?

02:14:35.088 --> 02:14:38.595
- Stay, Quill.
- Oh, man...

02:14:41.791 --> 02:14:43.486
Tony.

02:14:46.268 --> 02:14:50.330
There was no other way.

02:14:54.657 --> 02:14:56.766
Mr. Stark?

02:14:59.915 --> 02:15:03.461
I don't feel so good...

02:15:03.641 --> 02:15:07.563
- You're all right.
- I don't, I don't know what's happening...

02:15:08.781 --> 02:15:12.187
I don't wanna go. I don't wanna go.
Mr. Stark, please...

02:15:12.212 --> 02:15:14.945
Please. I don't wanna go.
I don't wanna go.

02:15:19.013 --> 02:15:22.177
I'm sorry.

02:15:35.331 --> 02:15:37.800
He did it.

02:16:01.565 --> 02:16:05.456
What is this? What the
hell is happening?

02:16:21.724 --> 02:16:24.583
Oh, God.

02:17:08.087 --> 02:17:12.431
Subbed by: iamdepressed
Resynched+fixed by Clarity.

02:27:19.849 --> 02:27:20.905
Search for Stark.

02:27:21.005 --> 02:27:22.038
No not yet.

02:27:22.138 --> 02:27:25.126
I'm watching every satellite above
kind of searching. Still nothing.

02:27:26.240 --> 02:27:29.707
- What is it?
- Multiple bogets over wakanda.

02:27:29.907 --> 02:27:31.645
Same energy signatures
as in New York?

02:27:31.845 --> 02:27:33.266
10 times bigger.

02:27:34.457 --> 02:27:36.316
Call Clint. We'll meet him...

02:27:50.627 --> 02:27:52.325
They okay?

02:27:52.525 --> 02:27:54.155
There is no one here.

02:28:04.362 --> 02:28:06.230
Call control.

02:28:06.430 --> 02:28:08.189

No!

02:28:27.231 --> 02:28:28.989
Oh no!
