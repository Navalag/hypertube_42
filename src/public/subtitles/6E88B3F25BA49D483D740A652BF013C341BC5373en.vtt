00:01:14.908 --> 00:01:17.094
Well, my dad was a farmer.

00:01:18.161 --> 00:01:20.722
Like everybody else back then.

00:01:22.749 --> 00:01:25.018
Of course, he didn't start that way.

00:01:31.216 --> 00:01:33.002
Computer says you're too tight.

00:01:33.102 --> 00:01:35.946
- Nah, I got this.
- Crossing the Straights.

00:01:38.265 --> 00:01:40.117
- Shutting it down, Cooper.
- No!

00:01:41.518 --> 00:01:44.037
- Shutting it all down.
- No, I need power up!

00:01:48.275 --> 00:01:49.418
Dad?

00:01:55.866 --> 00:01:58.602
Sorry, Murph. Go back to bed.

00:01:58.702 --> 00:02:01.304
- I thought you were the ghost.
- No.

00:02:02.873 --> 00:02:04.942
There are no such things
as ghosts, babe.

00:02:05.042 --> 00:02:07.310
Grandpa says you can get ghosts.

00:02:08.629 --> 00:02:13.583
Maybe that's because Grandpa's a little
too close to being one himself. Back to bed.

00:02:13.717 --> 00:02:15.652
Were you dreaming about the crash?

00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:19.364
Get your butt back in bed, Murph. Heh.

00:02:46.291 --> 00:02:47.893
The wheat had died.

00:02:48.627 --> 00:02:51.062
The blight came and we had to burn it.

00:02:51.380 --> 00:02:54.658
And we still had corn.
We had acres of corn.

00:02:54.758 --> 00:02:57.110
But... mostly we had dust.

00:02:59.429 --> 00:03:02.124
I guess I can't describe it.
It was just constant.

00:03:02.224 --> 00:03:06.203
Just that steady blow of dirt.

00:03:08.188 --> 00:03:11.341
We wore... little strips of sheet...

00:03:11.441 --> 00:03:14.219
sometimes over our nose and mouth...

00:03:14.319 --> 00:03:16.922
so that we wouldn't breathe
so much of it.

00:03:18.532 --> 00:03:22.211
Well, when we set the table,
we always set the plate upside-down.

00:03:22.311 --> 00:03:25.555
Glasses or cups,
whatever it was upside-down.

00:03:30.877 --> 00:03:32.996
Shake a leg! Murph, get a move on!

00:03:33.096 --> 00:03:36.825
Tom, 4:00 today, you and me in the barn,
Herbicide Resistance 101.

00:03:36.925 --> 00:03:38.527
- Check?
- Yes, sir.

00:03:39.970 --> 00:03:41.738
Not at the table, Murph.

00:03:42.389 --> 00:03:44.324
Dad, can you fix this?

00:03:45.809 --> 00:03:48.445
- What the heck did you do to my lander?
- Wasn't me.

00:03:48.545 --> 00:03:50.589
Let me guess. It was your ghost?

00:03:50.689 --> 00:03:53.091
It knocked it off.
It keeps knocking books off.

00:03:53.191 --> 00:03:55.016
- No such thing as ghosts, dumb-ass.
- Hey.

00:03:55.116 --> 00:03:58.372
- I looked it up. It's called a poltergeist.
- Dad, tell her.

00:03:58.472 --> 00:04:00.557
Well, it's not very scientific, Murph.

00:04:00.657 --> 00:04:03.060
You said science was about admitting
what we don't know.

00:04:03.260 --> 00:04:07.097
- She's got you there.
- Hey. Start looking after our stuff.

00:04:08.623 --> 00:04:09.933
Coop.

00:04:12.027 --> 00:04:14.896
All right, Murph,
you want to talk science?

00:04:15.756 --> 00:04:19.076
Don't tell me you're afraid of some ghost.
No, you got to go further.

00:04:19.176 --> 00:04:22.012
You got to record the facts, analyze,
get to the how and the why...

00:04:22.112 --> 00:04:25.532
then present your conclusions. Deal?

00:04:26.099 --> 00:04:27.617
- Deal.
- All right.

00:04:30.353 --> 00:04:32.622
- Have a good day at school.
- Hold up.

00:04:32.856 --> 00:04:37.344
Parent-teacher conferences. Parent.
Not grandparent.

00:04:39.529 --> 00:04:41.464
Slow down, turbo!

00:04:42.699 --> 00:04:45.994
- That's not a dust storm.
- Nelson's torching his whole crop.

00:04:46.094 --> 00:04:47.137
Blight?

00:04:47.237 --> 00:04:50.056
They're saying
it's the last harvest for okra.

00:04:50.624 --> 00:04:51.892
Ever.

00:04:53.610 --> 00:04:56.405
He should've planted corn
like the rest of us.

00:04:56.505 --> 00:04:59.282
Now, be nice to that Miss Hanley.
She's single.

00:04:59.382 --> 00:05:00.951
What's that supposed to mean?

00:05:01.051 --> 00:05:04.246
Repopulating the earth.
Start pulling your weight, young man.

00:05:04.346 --> 00:05:08.408
Why don't you start
minding your own business, old man?

00:05:15.607 --> 00:05:17.375
All right, Murph, give me second.

00:05:20.695 --> 00:05:22.139
Third.

00:05:23.615 --> 00:05:25.350
- Find a gear, dumb-ass.
- Grind it!

00:05:25.450 --> 00:05:26.593
Shut it, Tom!

00:05:27.869 --> 00:05:30.372
- What'd you do, Murph?
- She didn't do nothing.

00:05:30.472 --> 00:05:32.974
- Blew a tire is all.
- Murphy's Law.

00:05:33.708 --> 00:05:34.689
Shut up!

00:05:34.789 --> 00:05:37.062
- Grab the spare, Tom.
- That is the spare.

00:05:39.589 --> 00:05:41.191
Get the patch kit!

00:05:42.384 --> 00:05:45.662
- How am I supposed to patch it out here?
- You got to figure it out.

00:05:45.762 --> 00:05:47.822
I'm not always gonna be here
to help you.

00:05:56.147 --> 00:05:57.966
What's going on, Murph?

00:05:58.066 --> 00:06:01.344
Why did you and Mom name me
after something that's bad?

00:06:01.444 --> 00:06:04.798
- We didn't.
- Murphy's Law?

00:06:05.657 --> 00:06:09.811
Murphy's Law doesn't mean
that something bad will happen.

00:06:09.911 --> 00:06:13.356
What it means is
whatever can happen will happen.

00:06:13.456 --> 00:06:16.101
And that sounded just fine with us.

00:06:20.213 --> 00:06:21.856
Whoa!

00:06:22.540 --> 00:06:23.733
Get in.

00:06:25.010 --> 00:06:26.528
Get in, let's go.

00:06:27.762 --> 00:06:29.990
What about the flat tire?

00:06:32.851 --> 00:06:34.285
Yeah.

00:06:48.158 --> 00:06:52.229
It's an Indian Air Force drone.
Solar cells could power an entire farm.

00:06:52.329 --> 00:06:53.888
Take the wheel, Tom.

00:06:59.252 --> 00:07:00.687
Go, go, go!

00:07:02.172 --> 00:07:03.940
Keep that aimed right at it.

00:07:11.965 --> 00:07:14.484
Faster, Tom. I'm losing it.

00:07:14.851 --> 00:07:15.994
Right at it.

00:07:17.695 --> 00:07:18.938
Stay on it.

00:07:20.223 --> 00:07:21.507
Here we go.

00:07:24.027 --> 00:07:25.336
Whoa.

00:07:30.367 --> 00:07:32.052
Nice one, Tom.

00:07:38.516 --> 00:07:39.893
Dad?

00:07:40.210 --> 00:07:43.063
I almost got it. Don't stop. Don't stop!

00:07:43.421 --> 00:07:46.074
- Dad!
- Tom!

00:07:50.553 --> 00:07:52.989
You told me to keep driving.

00:07:53.723 --> 00:07:58.286
Well, I guess that answers the old
"If I asked you to drive off a cliff" scenario.

00:08:01.398 --> 00:08:04.334
- We lost it.
- No, we didn't.

00:08:16.913 --> 00:08:18.681
Want to give it a whirl?

00:08:24.587 --> 00:08:26.064
This way.

00:08:31.344 --> 00:08:32.529
Go.

00:08:33.430 --> 00:08:36.533
Let's lay her down right there
at the edge of the reservoir.

00:08:40.729 --> 00:08:42.539
Nicely done.

00:08:45.442 --> 00:08:47.385
How long you think it's been up there?

00:08:47.485 --> 00:08:50.096
Delhi Mission Control
went down, same as ours...

00:08:50.196 --> 00:08:52.132
- ...ten years ago.
- Heh.

00:08:52.365 --> 00:08:54.384
So for ten years?

00:08:57.245 --> 00:08:59.940
- Why did it come down so low?
- I don't know.

00:09:00.040 --> 00:09:03.026
Maybe the sun cooked its brain
or it was looking for something.

00:09:03.126 --> 00:09:05.478
- What?
- Give me a large flatblade.

00:09:05.795 --> 00:09:08.565
Maybe some kind of signal? I don't know.

00:09:13.820 --> 00:09:15.321
What are you gonna do with it?

00:09:16.139 --> 00:09:19.409
I'm gonna give it something
socially responsible to do...

00:09:20.185 --> 00:09:21.619
like drive a combine.

00:09:22.103 --> 00:09:23.705
Can't we just let it go?

00:09:25.899 --> 00:09:27.667
It wasn't hurting anybody.

00:09:29.235 --> 00:09:33.631
This thing needs to learn how to adapt,
Murph... like the rest of us.

00:09:38.119 --> 00:09:40.231
How's this work? You guys come with?

00:09:40.331 --> 00:09:43.833
I've got class. This one needs to wait.

00:09:45.376 --> 00:09:48.238
- What did you do?
- They'll tell you about it in there.

00:09:48.338 --> 00:09:50.573
- Am I gonna be mad?
- Not with me.

00:09:50.673 --> 00:09:53.943
- Just please try not to.
- Hey. Relax.

00:09:55.261 --> 00:09:56.696
I got this.

00:10:01.050 --> 00:10:03.920
- Little late, Coop.
- Yeah, we had a flat.

00:10:04.020 --> 00:10:07.665
And I guess you had to stop off
at the Asian fighter plane store.

00:10:07.857 --> 00:10:11.511
No, actually, sir,
that's a surveillance drone.

00:10:11.611 --> 00:10:14.464
With outstanding solar cells.
It's Indian.

00:10:14.781 --> 00:10:16.216
Take a seat.

00:10:17.242 --> 00:10:18.843
So...

00:10:19.452 --> 00:10:22.138
we got Tom's scores back.

00:10:22.580 --> 00:10:24.607
He's going to make an excellent farmer.

00:10:24.707 --> 00:10:28.278
Yeah, he's got a knack for it.
What about college?

00:10:28.378 --> 00:10:32.198
The university only takes a handful.
They don't have the resources to...

00:10:32.298 --> 00:10:34.659
I still pay my taxes.

00:10:34.759 --> 00:10:36.861
Where's that money go?
There's no more armies.

00:10:37.262 --> 00:10:39.697
Well, it doesn't go to the university.

00:10:40.381 --> 00:10:45.070
- Look, Coop, you have to be realistic.
- You're ruling my son out for college now?

00:10:45.311 --> 00:10:48.915
- The kid's 15.
- Tom's score simply isn't high enough.

00:10:49.816 --> 00:10:52.085
What's your waistline? About what, 32?

00:10:52.402 --> 00:10:56.139
- About a 33 inseam?
- I'm not sure I see what you're getting at.

00:10:56.239 --> 00:11:00.760
It takes two numbers to measure your ass
but only one to measure my son's future?

00:11:01.536 --> 00:11:04.481
Come on.
You're a well-educated man, Coop.

00:11:04.581 --> 00:11:06.641
- And a trained pilot.
- And an engineer.

00:11:07.041 --> 00:11:12.155
Okay, well, right now
we don't need more engineers.

00:11:12.255 --> 00:11:16.793
We didn't run out of television screens
and planes. We ran out of food.

00:11:16.926 --> 00:11:20.413
The world needs farmers.
Good farmers, like you.

00:11:20.513 --> 00:11:22.991
- And Tom.
- Uneducated farmers.

00:11:23.808 --> 00:11:27.796
We're a caretaker generation, Coop.
And things are getting better.

00:11:27.896 --> 00:11:31.124
- Maybe your grandkids will get to be engin...
- Are we done here, sir?

00:11:32.317 --> 00:11:33.501
No.

00:11:34.235 --> 00:11:36.504
Miss Hanley's here to talk about Murph.

00:11:36.738 --> 00:11:39.349
Murph is a great kid.
She's really bright.

00:11:39.449 --> 00:11:41.768
But she's been having
a little trouble lately.

00:11:41.868 --> 00:11:45.313
She brought this in to show the students.
The section on the lunar landings.

00:11:45.413 --> 00:11:50.443
Yeah, it's one of my old textbooks.
She always loved the pictures.

00:11:50.543 --> 00:11:54.322
It's an old federal textbook. We've
replaced them with the corrected versions.

00:11:54.422 --> 00:11:55.532
Corrected?

00:11:55.632 --> 00:12:00.061
Explaining how the Apollo missions
were faked to bankrupt the Soviet Union.

00:12:06.476 --> 00:12:08.536
You don't believe we went to the moon?

00:12:09.562 --> 00:12:11.631
It was a brilliant piece of propaganda.

00:12:11.731 --> 00:12:14.634
The Soviets bankrupted themselves
pouring resources...

00:12:14.734 --> 00:12:18.304
- into rockets and other useless machines.
- "Useless machines."

00:12:18.404 --> 00:12:22.559
If we don't want a repeat of the excess
and wastefulness of the 20th century, then...

00:12:22.659 --> 00:12:26.554
we need to teach our kids about this planet,
not tales of leaving it.

00:12:27.288 --> 00:12:31.392
One of those useless machines
they used to make was called an MRI.

00:12:31.668 --> 00:12:34.871
If we had any of those left,
the doctors would've been able to find...

00:12:34.971 --> 00:12:38.992
the cyst in my wife's brain
before she died instead of afterwards.

00:12:39.092 --> 00:12:42.245
Then she'd have been the one
listening to this instead of me...

00:12:42.345 --> 00:12:45.731
which would have been a good thing,
because she was always...

00:12:46.015 --> 00:12:47.617
the calmer one.

00:12:48.184 --> 00:12:50.770
I'm sorry about your wife, Mr. Cooper.

00:12:51.521 --> 00:12:55.258
But Murph got into a fistfight
with several of her classmates over this...

00:12:55.358 --> 00:12:59.721
Apollo nonsense. So we thought it best
to bring you in and see what ideas...

00:12:59.821 --> 00:13:02.590
you might have for dealing
with her behavior on the home front.

00:13:03.700 --> 00:13:06.811
Yeah, you know what?
There's a game tomorrow night.

00:13:06.911 --> 00:13:09.105
She's going through
a bit of a baseball phase.

00:13:09.205 --> 00:13:13.518
Her favorite team is playing.
There's gonna be candy and soda and...

00:13:16.504 --> 00:13:18.439
I think I'll take her to that.

00:13:23.678 --> 00:13:25.229
How'd it go?

00:13:25.847 --> 00:13:27.824
I got you suspended.

00:13:28.141 --> 00:13:29.575
- What?
- Cooper.

00:13:31.227 --> 00:13:32.462
This is Cooper. Go.

00:13:32.562 --> 00:13:35.465
Coop, those combines you rebuilt
went haywire.

00:13:35.565 --> 00:13:37.834
Just reset the controllers.

00:13:38.067 --> 00:13:40.795
I did that.
Now you should come take a look.

00:14:00.423 --> 00:14:03.593
One by one they've been peeling off
the fields and heading over.

00:14:03.693 --> 00:14:05.528
Something's interfering
with the compass.

00:14:06.929 --> 00:14:09.407
Magnetism or some such.

00:14:52.425 --> 00:14:56.913
Nothing special about which book.
I've been working on it, like you said.

00:14:57.563 --> 00:15:00.466
- I counted the spaces.
- Why?

00:15:02.110 --> 00:15:04.495
In case the ghost
is trying to communicate.

00:15:04.987 --> 00:15:06.831
I'm trying Morse.

00:15:07.115 --> 00:15:08.599
Morse?

00:15:08.699 --> 00:15:10.084
Yeah.

00:15:10.201 --> 00:15:12.895
- Dots and dashes, used...
- I know what Morse code is, Murph.

00:15:12.995 --> 00:15:16.215
I just don't think your bookshelf's
trying to talk to you.

00:15:27.510 --> 00:15:31.989
Had to reset every compass clock and GPS
to offset for the anomaly.

00:15:32.181 --> 00:15:34.825
- Which is?
- I don't know.

00:15:36.519 --> 00:15:38.713
If the house was built
on magnetic ore...

00:15:38.813 --> 00:15:41.999
we'd have seen this the first time
we switched on the tractor.

00:15:44.569 --> 00:15:47.838
I hear your meeting at the school
didn't go so well.

00:15:48.364 --> 00:15:50.174
Heh. You heard?

00:15:51.033 --> 00:15:53.970
It's like we've forgotten
who we are, Donald.

00:15:55.538 --> 00:15:59.441
Explorers, pioneers, not caretakers.

00:16:00.751 --> 00:16:02.445
When I was a kid...

00:16:02.545 --> 00:16:06.774
it felt like they made something new
every day. Some...

00:16:07.049 --> 00:16:10.444
gadget or idea.
Like every day was Christmas.

00:16:10.803 --> 00:16:15.992
But six billion people...
just try to imagine that.

00:16:16.893 --> 00:16:19.996
And every last one of them
trying to have it all.

00:16:23.274 --> 00:16:25.693
This world isn't so bad.

00:16:27.445 --> 00:16:31.289
And Tom will do just fine.
You're the one who doesn't belong.

00:16:31.389 --> 00:16:34.402
Born 40 years too late,
or 40 years too early.

00:16:35.203 --> 00:16:38.005
My daughter knew it, God bless her.

00:16:38.581 --> 00:16:41.475
And your kids know it. Especially Murph.

00:16:41.709 --> 00:16:45.196
Well, we used to look up in the sky
and wonder...

00:16:45.296 --> 00:16:47.973
at our place in the stars.

00:16:50.092 --> 00:16:54.572
Now we just look down and worry
about our place in the dirt.

00:16:54.972 --> 00:16:57.908
Cooper, you were good at something...

00:16:58.142 --> 00:17:00.745
and you never got a chance
to do anything with it.

00:17:01.437 --> 00:17:03.072
I'm sorry.

00:17:04.582 --> 00:17:08.711
You didn't expect this dirt
that was giving you this food...

00:17:08.945 --> 00:17:12.131
to turn on you like that
and destroy you.

00:17:12.432 --> 00:17:16.761
In April... I believe I'm right...
Fifteenth of April, I think.

00:17:17.119 --> 00:17:21.566
This happened about 1:30 when that thing...
came off the top of that canyon.

00:17:23.209 --> 00:17:27.530
In my day, we had real ballplayers.
Who are these bums?

00:17:27.630 --> 00:17:32.443
In my day, people were too busy
fighting over food to even play baseball.

00:17:32.635 --> 00:17:37.382
Popcorn at a ballgame is unnatural.
I want a hot dog.

00:17:37.482 --> 00:17:40.109
School says you're gonna follow
in my footsteps.

00:17:40.560 --> 00:17:42.161
I think that's great.

00:17:42.353 --> 00:17:45.748
- You think that's great?
- You hate farming, Dad.

00:17:46.440 --> 00:17:48.134
Grandpa said.

00:17:48.234 --> 00:17:49.752
Grandpa said?

00:17:50.069 --> 00:17:52.680
Listen, all that matters
is how you feel about it.

00:17:52.780 --> 00:17:54.548
I like what you do.

00:17:55.157 --> 00:17:56.759
I like our farm.

00:17:57.326 --> 00:17:59.020
You're gonna be great at it.

00:18:11.999 --> 00:18:13.801
Let's get out of here.

00:18:20.558 --> 00:18:22.660
All right, it's a doozy.

00:18:23.269 --> 00:18:25.204
All right, gang, let's mask up.

00:18:28.441 --> 00:18:30.543
- Tom? Murph? Check?
- Yeah.

00:19:23.996 --> 00:19:26.682
Murph, Tom, you guys shut your windows?

00:19:31.003 --> 00:19:32.188
Murph?

00:19:53.484 --> 00:19:54.877
The ghost.

00:19:56.028 --> 00:19:57.755
Grab your pillow.

00:19:58.047 --> 00:20:00.382
You're sleeping in with Tom.

00:20:55.112 --> 00:20:56.981
It's not a ghost.

00:21:01.903 --> 00:21:03.821
It's gravity.

00:21:05.473 --> 00:21:07.825
I'm dropping Tom, then heading to town.

00:21:08.017 --> 00:21:12.288
You want to clean that up
when you've finished praying to it?

00:21:37.546 --> 00:21:39.899
It's not Morse, Murph. It's binary.

00:21:40.299 --> 00:21:42.459
Thick is one, thin is zero.

00:21:46.722 --> 00:21:48.157
Coordinates.

00:21:50.643 --> 00:21:53.245
Nope.

00:21:54.605 --> 00:21:55.873
Here we go.

00:21:57.358 --> 00:21:58.834
Thirty-three.

00:22:01.695 --> 00:22:02.838
That's it.

00:22:04.198 --> 00:22:05.799
I can't miss this!

00:22:06.033 --> 00:22:09.303
Grandpa will be back
in a couple hours, Murph.

00:22:09.995 --> 00:22:12.765
But you don't know
what you're gonna find.

00:22:13.666 --> 00:22:15.300
And that...

00:22:16.085 --> 00:22:18.270
is why I can't take you.

00:22:24.260 --> 00:22:25.486
Murph?

00:22:27.471 --> 00:22:31.075
Grandpa will be home in a while.
Tell him I'll call him on the radio.

00:22:37.147 --> 00:22:38.499
Jesus.

00:22:39.400 --> 00:22:41.385
- What are you doing?
- Heh-heh.

00:22:41.485 --> 00:22:43.712
Oh, you think this is funny?

00:22:43.946 --> 00:22:46.382
You wouldn't be here
if it wasn't for me.

00:22:48.117 --> 00:22:50.219
Make yourself useful.

00:23:53.474 --> 00:23:55.208
Hey, Murph?

00:23:56.435 --> 00:23:57.978
Murph.

00:24:00.981 --> 00:24:03.417
I think this is the end of the road.

00:24:06.320 --> 00:24:08.464
Didn't you bring the bolt cutters?

00:24:09.531 --> 00:24:10.883
That's my girl.

00:24:38.519 --> 00:24:39.837
Step away!

00:24:39.937 --> 00:24:43.090
Don't shoot! I'm not armed.
My daughter's in the car.

00:24:48.570 --> 00:24:50.923
Don't be afraid.

00:25:03.544 --> 00:25:05.729
How did you find this place?

00:25:06.338 --> 00:25:07.773
Where's my daughter?

00:25:07.965 --> 00:25:11.952
You had the coordinates for this facility
marked on your map. Where did you get them?

00:25:12.052 --> 00:25:13.254
Where's my daughter?

00:25:13.354 --> 00:25:16.573
Don't make me take you down again.
Sit down!

00:25:16.807 --> 00:25:19.084
Oh, you still think
you're a Marine, pal?

00:25:19.184 --> 00:25:21.870
Marines don't exist anymore.

00:25:22.062 --> 00:25:27.092
- And I got grunts like you mowing my grass.
- Where did you find those coordinates?

00:25:27.192 --> 00:25:29.845
But you don't look much
like a lawnmower.

00:25:29.945 --> 00:25:32.848
Think I'll turn you
into an overqualified vacuum cleaner.

00:25:32.948 --> 00:25:34.258
No, you won't.

00:25:35.784 --> 00:25:37.803
TARS, back down, please.

00:25:39.204 --> 00:25:42.432
You know, you're taking a risk
using ex-military security.

00:25:42.791 --> 00:25:46.695
They're old, and their control units
are unpredictable.

00:25:46.795 --> 00:25:48.864
It's what the government could spare.

00:25:50.466 --> 00:25:51.733
Who are you?

00:25:52.092 --> 00:25:53.494
Dr. Brand.

00:25:53.594 --> 00:25:56.071
I knew a Dr. Brand once.
He was a professor.

00:25:56.346 --> 00:25:57.948
What makes you think I'm not?

00:25:58.307 --> 00:26:00.876
Wasn't near as cute, either.

00:26:00.976 --> 00:26:03.579
Please, Dr. Brand.
I don't have any idea what this is.

00:26:04.313 --> 00:26:06.882
Now I'm scared for my daughter
and want her by my side.

00:26:06.982 --> 00:26:09.543
You give me that,
I'll tell you anything you want to know.

00:26:12.821 --> 00:26:15.924
Get the principals and the girl
in the conference room, please.

00:26:17.359 --> 00:26:20.137
Your daughter is fine. Bright kid.

00:26:20.621 --> 00:26:22.523
Must have a very smart mother.

00:26:22.623 --> 00:26:25.109
It's pretty clear
you don't want any visitors.

00:26:25.209 --> 00:26:29.271
So why don't you just let us back up from
your fence and we'll be on our way?

00:26:29.463 --> 00:26:32.107
- It's not that simple.
- Well, sure, it is.

00:26:32.341 --> 00:26:36.111
I don't know anything about you.
I don't know anything about this place.

00:26:36.887 --> 00:26:38.155
Yes, you do.

00:26:43.769 --> 00:26:44.953
Dad!

00:26:47.523 --> 00:26:48.665
Hello, Cooper.

00:26:50.025 --> 00:26:51.168
Professor Brand.

00:26:52.536 --> 00:26:55.264
Explain to me
how you found this facility.

00:26:55.364 --> 00:26:58.726
Kind of an accident. We sort of stumbled
upon it. We were on a salvage run...

00:26:58.826 --> 00:27:01.603
You're sitting in the best-kept secret
in the world.

00:27:01.703 --> 00:27:05.307
Nobody stumbles in here.
Nobody stumbles out.

00:27:05.541 --> 00:27:09.820
Cooper, please.
Cooperate with these people.

00:27:09.920 --> 00:27:11.230
Look.

00:27:12.047 --> 00:27:13.815
It's kind of hard to explain.

00:27:14.049 --> 00:27:18.871
We learned these coordinates
from an anomaly.

00:27:18.971 --> 00:27:20.372
What sort of anomaly?

00:27:20.472 --> 00:27:23.834
I hesitate to term it supernatural,
but it definitely wasn't scientific.

00:27:23.934 --> 00:27:27.921
You're going to have to be specific,
Mr. Cooper. Right now.

00:27:28.021 --> 00:27:29.373
It was gravity.

00:27:34.247 --> 00:27:37.222
What sort of gravitational anomaly?
Where was this?

00:27:37.322 --> 00:27:40.684
Now, I'm real happy that you're excited
about gravity, bud...

00:27:40.784 --> 00:27:43.663
but you're not getting any answers
from us until I get assurances.

00:27:43.763 --> 00:27:45.555
- Assurances?
- Yeah.

00:27:46.290 --> 00:27:49.818
Like, that we're getting out of here.
And I don't mean in the trunk of some car.

00:27:52.296 --> 00:27:55.908
- Don't you know who we are, Coop?
- No, professor, I don't.

00:27:56.008 --> 00:27:58.110
You know my father, Professor Brand.

00:27:58.635 --> 00:28:00.028
We're NASA.

00:28:01.722 --> 00:28:04.032
- NASA?
- NASA.

00:28:04.266 --> 00:28:06.159
The same NASA you flew for.

00:28:17.112 --> 00:28:18.847
I heard they shut you down, sir...

00:28:18.947 --> 00:28:23.018
for refusing to drop bombs
from the stratosphere onto starving people.

00:28:23.118 --> 00:28:25.521
When they realized
that killing other people was...

00:28:25.621 --> 00:28:28.524
not a long-term solution,
then they needed us back.

00:28:28.624 --> 00:28:30.692
- In secret.
- Why secret?

00:28:30.792 --> 00:28:34.788
Because public opinion wouldn't allow
spending on space exploration.

00:28:34.888 --> 00:28:37.482
Not while you're struggling
to put food on the table.

00:28:38.800 --> 00:28:40.068
Blight.

00:28:40.427 --> 00:28:44.664
Wheat seven years ago. Okra this year.

00:28:45.015 --> 00:28:46.783
Now there's just corn.

00:28:47.017 --> 00:28:49.044
And we're growing more
than we ever have.

00:28:49.144 --> 00:28:53.415
But like the potatoes in Ireland
and the wheat in the Dust Bowl...

00:28:53.899 --> 00:28:56.501
the corn will die.

00:28:57.152 --> 00:28:58.295
Soon.

00:29:03.492 --> 00:29:07.179
We'll find a way, professor.
We always have.

00:29:07.829 --> 00:29:11.933
Driven by the unshakable faith
the Earth is ours.

00:29:12.334 --> 00:29:16.438
Not just ours, no. But it is our home.

00:29:17.673 --> 00:29:22.953
Earth's atmosphere is 80 percent nitrogen.
We don't even breathe nitrogen.

00:29:23.053 --> 00:29:28.458
Blight does. And as it thrives,
our air gets less and less oxygen.

00:29:28.558 --> 00:29:32.087
The last people to starve
will be the first to suffocate.

00:29:32.187 --> 00:29:34.456
And your daughter's generation...

00:29:35.924 --> 00:29:38.343
will be the last to survive on Earth.

00:29:38.443 --> 00:29:42.130
Murph is feeling tired. I was wondering
if she could take a nap in my office.

00:29:42.531 --> 00:29:44.132
Yeah. Thank you.

00:29:46.827 --> 00:29:48.269
Alright...

00:29:48.870 --> 00:29:52.474
now you need to tell me
what your plan is to save the world.

00:29:53.041 --> 00:29:56.645
We're not meant to save the world.
We're meant to leave it.

00:30:02.384 --> 00:30:03.527
Rangers.

00:30:03.719 --> 00:30:08.782
The last components of our one versatile ship
in orbit, the Endurance.

00:30:08.974 --> 00:30:10.700
Our final expedition.

00:30:11.393 --> 00:30:14.454
You sent people out there
looking for a new home?

00:30:14.980 --> 00:30:16.373
The Lazarus missions.

00:30:16.606 --> 00:30:19.668
- Oh, that sounds cheerful.
- Lazarus came back from the dead.

00:30:19.901 --> 00:30:22.003
Sure, but he had to die
in the first place.

00:30:22.529 --> 00:30:25.307
There's not a planet in our solar system
that could sustain life...

00:30:25.407 --> 00:30:27.976
and the nearest star's
over a thousand years away.

00:30:28.076 --> 00:30:30.846
That doesn't even qualify as futile.

00:30:32.414 --> 00:30:33.849
Where'd you send them?

00:30:34.166 --> 00:30:35.651
Cooper...

00:30:35.751 --> 00:30:40.614
I can't tell you anymore
unless you agree to pilot this craft.

00:30:40.714 --> 00:30:44.109
- You're the best pilot we ever had.
- I barely left the stratosphere.

00:30:44.301 --> 00:30:46.528
This team never left the simulator.

00:30:46.762 --> 00:30:50.624
We need a pilot, and this is the mission
that you were trained for.

00:30:50.724 --> 00:30:52.325
Without even knowing it?

00:30:53.268 --> 00:30:57.589
An hour ago, you didn't even know
I was alive. You were going anyway.

00:30:57.689 --> 00:31:01.418
We had no choice.
But something sent you here.

00:31:01.651 --> 00:31:04.463
- They chose you.
- Who's "they"?

00:31:12.329 --> 00:31:14.347
How long would I be gone?

00:31:14.831 --> 00:31:18.051
Hard to know. Years?

00:31:18.460 --> 00:31:22.731
- I've got kids, professor.
- Get out there and save them.

00:31:26.009 --> 00:31:27.452
Who's "they"?

00:31:27.552 --> 00:31:31.581
We started detecting gravitational
anomalies almost 50 years ago.

00:31:31.681 --> 00:31:35.377
Mostly small distortions to our instruments
in the upper atmosphere.

00:31:35.477 --> 00:31:38.705
In fact, I believe
you encountered one yourself.

00:31:39.272 --> 00:31:41.774
Yeah, over the Straights.

00:31:42.275 --> 00:31:45.387
My crash.
Something tripped my fly-by-wire.

00:31:45.487 --> 00:31:46.796
Exactly.

00:31:47.531 --> 00:31:52.519
But of all these anomalies,
the most significant is this:

00:31:52.619 --> 00:31:54.688
Out near Saturn...

00:31:54.788 --> 00:31:56.973
a disturbance of space-time.

00:31:59.000 --> 00:32:02.229
- Is that a Wormhole?
- It appeared 48 years ago.

00:32:02.587 --> 00:32:06.775
- And it leads where?
- Another galaxy.

00:32:08.427 --> 00:32:10.746
A wormhole's not
a naturally occurring phenomenon.

00:32:10.846 --> 00:32:12.364
Someone placed it there.

00:32:13.056 --> 00:32:14.658
"They"?

00:32:15.058 --> 00:32:19.246
And whoever they are,
they appear to be looking out for us.

00:32:19.604 --> 00:32:24.343
That Wormhole lets us travel to other stars.
It came along right as we needed it.

00:32:24.443 --> 00:32:27.429
They've put potentially habitable worlds
right within our reach.

00:32:27.529 --> 00:32:29.514
Twelve, in fact,
from our initial probes.

00:32:29.614 --> 00:32:32.059
You sent probes into that?

00:32:32.159 --> 00:32:35.562
We sent people into it. Ten years ago.

00:32:36.496 --> 00:32:38.398
The Lazarus missions.

00:32:38.498 --> 00:32:42.310
Twelve possible worlds,
twelve Ranger launches carrying...

00:32:42.669 --> 00:32:48.183
the bravest humans ever to live...
led by the remarkable Dr. Mann.

00:32:48.283 --> 00:32:51.453
Each person's landing pod
had enough life support for two years.

00:32:51.553 --> 00:32:53.580
But they could use hibernation
to stretch that...

00:32:53.680 --> 00:32:56.958
making observations on organics
over a decade or more.

00:32:57.058 --> 00:33:00.996
Their mission was to assess their world,
and if it showed potential...

00:33:01.229 --> 00:33:05.717
then they could send out a signal,
bed down for the long nap, wait to be rescued.

00:33:05.817 --> 00:33:07.961
And what if the world
didn't show promise?

00:33:08.487 --> 00:33:10.005
Hence the bravery.

00:33:10.697 --> 00:33:13.308
You don't have the resources
to visit all 12.

00:33:13.408 --> 00:33:14.834
No.

00:33:15.410 --> 00:33:18.271
Data transmission back through
the Wormhole is rudimentary.

00:33:18.371 --> 00:33:23.485
Simple binary pings on an annual basis give us
some clue as to which worlds have potential.

00:33:23.585 --> 00:33:25.478
And one system shows promise.

00:33:25.712 --> 00:33:28.656
One. That's a bit
of a long shot, isn't it?

00:33:29.090 --> 00:33:32.027
One system with three potential worlds?

00:33:32.344 --> 00:33:34.329
No long shot.

00:33:36.097 --> 00:33:37.324
Okay.

00:33:37.933 --> 00:33:40.568
So if we find a home...

00:33:42.938 --> 00:33:46.499
- ...then what?
- That's the long shot.

00:33:46.733 --> 00:33:50.045
There's a Plan A and a Plan B.

00:33:50.445 --> 00:33:53.506
Did you notice anything strange
about the launch chamber?

00:34:05.126 --> 00:34:08.146
This entire facility's a centrifuge.

00:34:08.380 --> 00:34:10.982
Some kind of vehicle. A space station?

00:34:11.216 --> 00:34:15.287
- Both. Plan A.
- How do you get it off the ground?

00:34:15.387 --> 00:34:19.291
The first gravitational anomalies
changed everything.

00:34:19.391 --> 00:34:23.928
Suddenly we knew
that harnessing gravity was real.

00:34:24.062 --> 00:34:28.833
So I started working on a theory
and we started building this station.

00:34:29.109 --> 00:34:31.494
But you haven't solved it yet.

00:34:32.279 --> 00:34:33.922
That's why there's Plan B.

00:34:34.322 --> 00:34:39.102
The problem is gravity. How to get
a viable amount of human life off the planet.

00:34:39.202 --> 00:34:40.595
This is one way.

00:34:40.829 --> 00:34:43.431
Plan B: A population bomb.

00:34:43.665 --> 00:34:48.520
Over 5,000 fertilized eggs
weighing in at just under 900 kilos.

00:34:49.129 --> 00:34:50.697
How would you raise them?

00:34:50.797 --> 00:34:53.325
With equipment on board,
we incubate the first 10.

00:34:53.425 --> 00:34:57.404
After that, with surrogacy,
the growth becomes exponential.

00:34:58.013 --> 00:35:01.374
Within 30 years,
we could have a colony of hundreds.

00:35:01.474 --> 00:35:04.953
The real difficulty with colonization
is genetic diversity.

00:35:05.478 --> 00:35:07.088
This takes care of that.

00:35:07.188 --> 00:35:09.749
But what about the people here?
You just...

00:35:10.025 --> 00:35:13.536
You give up on them? My kids?

00:35:13.778 --> 00:35:17.215
That's why Plan A is a lot more fun.

00:35:19.367 --> 00:35:22.312
- How far have you got?
- Almost there.

00:35:22.412 --> 00:35:24.931
You're asking me to hang everything...

00:35:25.874 --> 00:35:27.308
on an almost.

00:35:27.751 --> 00:35:30.145
I'm asking you to trust me.

00:35:33.131 --> 00:35:34.899
Find us a new home.

00:35:35.550 --> 00:35:37.652
And by the time you return...

00:35:38.136 --> 00:35:40.905
I will have solved
the problem of gravity.

00:35:41.765 --> 00:35:43.450
I give you my word.

00:35:55.987 --> 00:35:57.589
Go away!

00:36:08.166 --> 00:36:09.484
Murph.

00:36:09.584 --> 00:36:12.687
Go! If you're leaving, just go.

00:36:15.382 --> 00:36:18.418
This world was never enough
for you, was it, Coop?

00:36:19.052 --> 00:36:23.306
What, because heading out there
is what I feel like I was born to do?

00:36:23.765 --> 00:36:25.700
And it excites me? Heh.

00:36:26.309 --> 00:36:28.837
No, that does not make it wrong.

00:36:28.937 --> 00:36:33.666
It might. Don't trust the right thing
done for the wrong reason.

00:36:34.317 --> 00:36:36.720
The why of the thing,
that's the foundation.

00:36:36.820 --> 00:36:39.205
And the foundation's solid.

00:36:42.075 --> 00:36:47.180
We farmers, we sit here every year
when the rains fail and we say:

00:36:47.372 --> 00:36:48.723
"Next year."

00:36:49.290 --> 00:36:53.061
Well, next year ain't gonna save us,
nor the one after that.

00:36:53.295 --> 00:36:58.024
This world's a treasure, Donald,
but it's been telling us to leave for a while now.

00:37:02.637 --> 00:37:06.533
Mankind was born on Earth,
it was never meant to die here.

00:37:09.561 --> 00:37:12.839
Tom will be all right, but you got
to make things right with Murph.

00:37:12.939 --> 00:37:14.582
I will.

00:37:14.941 --> 00:37:18.211
Without making promises
you don't know you can keep.

00:37:28.747 --> 00:37:30.849
You have to talk to me, Murph.

00:37:33.251 --> 00:37:35.445
I need to fix this before I go.

00:37:35.545 --> 00:37:38.523
Then I'll keep it broken
so you have to stay.

00:37:40.008 --> 00:37:45.113
After you kids came along, your mom said
something to me I never quite understood.

00:37:45.388 --> 00:37:47.515
She said, "Now...

00:37:48.892 --> 00:37:53.496
we're just here
to be memories for our kids."

00:37:58.526 --> 00:38:01.129
And I think that now I understand
what she meant.

00:38:04.783 --> 00:38:08.636
Once you're a parent,
you're the ghost of your children's future.

00:38:10.163 --> 00:38:12.432
You said ghosts didn't exist.

00:38:18.797 --> 00:38:20.398
That's right, Murph.

00:38:23.510 --> 00:38:25.344
Murph, look at me.

00:38:27.889 --> 00:38:30.491
I can't be your ghost right now.

00:38:32.185 --> 00:38:34.487
I need to exist.

00:38:35.814 --> 00:38:37.832
They chose me.

00:38:38.441 --> 00:38:42.503
Murph, they chose me. You saw.
You're the one who led me to them.

00:38:45.031 --> 00:38:47.634
That's exactly why you can't go.

00:38:50.745 --> 00:38:52.805
I figured out the message.

00:38:53.122 --> 00:38:56.401
- One word. Know what it is?
- Murph.

00:38:56.501 --> 00:38:57.936
"Stay."

00:38:58.211 --> 00:39:01.189
- It says, "Stay," Dad.
- Murph.

00:39:02.048 --> 00:39:03.575
You don't believe me.

00:39:03.675 --> 00:39:06.536
Look at the books! Look at this.
It says, "Stay."

00:39:06.636 --> 00:39:09.697
Why...? You're not listening!
It says, "Stay!"

00:39:09.931 --> 00:39:13.668
- No, I'm coming back.
- When?

00:39:26.281 --> 00:39:29.017
One for you, one for me.

00:39:29.117 --> 00:39:32.387
When I'm up there in hypersleep, or...

00:39:32.620 --> 00:39:35.964
traveling near the speed of light, or...

00:39:36.165 --> 00:39:38.651
near a black hole...

00:39:38.751 --> 00:39:43.598
time's gonna change for me.
It's gonna run more slowly.

00:39:44.883 --> 00:39:47.276
When we get back...

00:39:47.802 --> 00:39:49.287
we're gonna compare.

00:39:49.387 --> 00:39:52.315
- Time will run differently for us?
- Yeah.

00:39:53.099 --> 00:39:57.870
By the time I get back,
we might even be the same age, you and me.

00:39:58.146 --> 00:40:01.481
"What?" Imagine that!

00:40:05.028 --> 00:40:06.262
Aw, Murph...

00:40:06.362 --> 00:40:09.390
You have no idea when you're coming back.

00:40:10.783 --> 00:40:12.929
No idea at all!

00:40:15.413 --> 00:40:17.607
Murph, don't...
Don't make me leave like this.

00:40:17.707 --> 00:40:19.308
Come on, Murph!

00:40:19.709 --> 00:40:22.445
Don't make me leave like this, Murph!

00:40:29.636 --> 00:40:30.778
Hey...

00:40:31.220 --> 00:40:35.208
I love you. Forever. You hear me?

00:40:35.308 --> 00:40:38.819
I love you forever, and I'm coming back.

00:40:44.317 --> 00:40:45.952
I'm coming back.

00:41:03.878 --> 00:41:06.447
- How'd it go?
- Fine.

00:41:06.798 --> 00:41:08.357
Just fine.

00:41:14.722 --> 00:41:15.948
I love you, Tom.

00:41:16.391 --> 00:41:18.585
- Travel safe?
- Yeah.

00:41:18.685 --> 00:41:21.004
You look after our place
for me, all right?

00:41:21.104 --> 00:41:22.830
All right?

00:41:27.435 --> 00:41:31.113
- Hey, can I use your truck while you're gone?
- You mean your truck?

00:41:32.115 --> 00:41:34.041
I'll make sure they bring it back.

00:41:35.868 --> 00:41:37.962
Look after my kids, Donald!

00:41:50.133 --> 00:41:53.861
Go for main engine start. T-minus 10...

00:41:54.829 --> 00:41:56.581
- Dad!
- ...nine...

00:41:56.681 --> 00:41:58.032
Dad!

00:41:58.758 --> 00:42:00.402
...eight...

00:42:01.135 --> 00:42:03.738
- seven...
- Dad!

00:42:03.971 --> 00:42:05.314
...six...

00:42:06.490 --> 00:42:09.210
five, main engine start, four...

00:42:10.645 --> 00:42:11.912
three...

00:42:12.480 --> 00:42:13.706
two...

00:42:14.523 --> 00:42:16.709
one. Booster ignition and...

00:42:25.877 --> 00:42:28.437
All engines look good.
Beginning roll program.

00:42:32.633 --> 00:42:35.570
Prepare for stage one separation.

00:42:35.803 --> 00:42:36.946
Stage one.

00:42:42.810 --> 00:42:44.745
There is Mach 1.

00:42:45.605 --> 00:42:49.417
Everybody good?
Plenty of slaves for my robot colony?

00:42:51.194 --> 00:42:54.589
They gave him a humor setting
so he'd fit in better with his unit.

00:42:54.822 --> 00:42:56.557
He thinks it relaxes us.

00:42:56.657 --> 00:42:59.552
A giant sarcastic robot.

00:43:00.328 --> 00:43:01.813
What a great idea!

00:43:01.913 --> 00:43:04.691
I have a cue light I can use
when I'm joking if you like.

00:43:04.791 --> 00:43:05.900
That'd probably help.

00:43:06.000 --> 00:43:10.021
You can use it to find your way back
to the ship after I blow you out the airlock.

00:43:11.005 --> 00:43:14.075
- What's your humor setting, TARS?
- That's 100 percent.

00:43:14.175 --> 00:43:16.068
Let's bring it on down to 75, please.

00:43:16.302 --> 00:43:18.237
Stage two separation.

00:43:28.815 --> 00:43:31.175
All feeds going manual.

00:43:31.275 --> 00:43:33.193
Going manual.

00:43:34.987 --> 00:43:37.223
Deactivate probe heater one,
two and three.

00:43:37.323 --> 00:43:38.466
Check.

00:43:43.955 --> 00:43:46.974
- Taking control.
- This is handover to you.

00:43:50.711 --> 00:43:53.105
- A.D.F. check.
- Over.

00:43:53.339 --> 00:43:57.076
Pull thrusters back.
Fuel cells one, two, three.

00:43:57.176 --> 00:44:00.613
- One hundred percent.
- Ex-mites.

00:44:09.480 --> 00:44:14.293
It's hard leaving everything.
My kids. Your father.

00:44:14.819 --> 00:44:17.263
We're going to be spending
a lot of time together.

00:44:17.363 --> 00:44:20.508
- We should learn to talk.
- And when not to.

00:44:22.702 --> 00:44:24.312
Just being honest.

00:44:24.412 --> 00:44:26.847
I don't think you need to be that honest.

00:44:27.165 --> 00:44:29.650
Hey, TARS, what's your honesty parameter?

00:44:29.750 --> 00:44:32.445
- Ninety percent.
- Ninety percent?

00:44:32.545 --> 00:44:35.243
Absolute honesty isn't always
the most diplomatic,

00:44:35.343 --> 00:44:38.409
nor the safest form of communication
with emotional beings.

00:44:38.509 --> 00:44:40.069
Okay.

00:44:40.428 --> 00:44:43.155
Ninety percent it is, Dr. Brand.

00:44:46.767 --> 00:44:50.079
We are coming up on the Endurance.
Twelve minutes out.

00:45:07.079 --> 00:45:09.181
Okay. Taking control.

00:45:12.543 --> 00:45:15.521
Approaching module port, 500 meters.

00:45:28.434 --> 00:45:29.660
It's all you, Doyle.

00:45:48.120 --> 00:45:50.681
Nice and easy, Doyle. Nice and easy.

00:45:55.753 --> 00:45:58.406
- I feel good.
- Take us home.

00:46:06.138 --> 00:46:08.441
- Lock.
- Target locked.

00:46:08.541 --> 00:46:10.543
- Well done.
- Okay, helmets on.

00:46:10.643 --> 00:46:11.786
Good job.

00:46:45.136 --> 00:46:48.656
Door's not charging. Never mind.

00:47:11.329 --> 00:47:13.139
Cooper, you should have control.

00:47:13.372 --> 00:47:14.974
Control here.

00:47:16.292 --> 00:47:19.019
Communication with ring module active.

00:47:25.384 --> 00:47:27.027
Oh, wow.

00:47:32.725 --> 00:47:33.993
That's initiate.

00:47:41.442 --> 00:47:44.044
- Are we ready to spin?
- Just a sec.

00:47:55.373 --> 00:47:57.808
- Hello, CASE.
- Hello, TARS.

00:47:58.667 --> 00:48:00.686
All right, we're all set.

00:48:01.045 --> 00:48:02.646
All right, let's do it.

00:48:20.856 --> 00:48:22.458
Heh.

00:48:31.700 --> 00:48:33.093
Thirty percent of spin.

00:48:39.917 --> 00:48:41.352
One G.

00:48:42.002 --> 00:48:44.104
How's gravity treating you back there?

00:48:44.338 --> 00:48:46.006
Well.

00:48:48.676 --> 00:48:50.536
Romilly? Hey, you okay?

00:48:50.636 --> 00:48:51.746
- Yeah.
- You all right?

00:48:51.846 --> 00:48:54.031
Yeah, I just need a minute.

00:48:54.348 --> 00:48:57.640
I think we have some Dramamine
in the hab pod, I'm just gonna get that

00:48:57.740 --> 00:48:59.600
or maybe in the cryo-beds.
I'll just be a sec.

00:48:59.700 --> 00:49:01.455
- Hey, Brand?
- Yeah?

00:49:01.689 --> 00:49:03.316
- Bring a lot.
- Heh-heh-heh.

00:49:11.991 --> 00:49:14.969
Amelia, be safe.

00:49:15.202 --> 00:49:18.773
- Give my regards to Dr. Mann.
- I will, Dad.

00:49:18.873 --> 00:49:24.395
It looks good for your trajectory.
We've calculated two years to Saturn.

00:49:24.845 --> 00:49:26.647
That's a lot of Dramamine.

00:49:27.256 --> 00:49:29.817
Look after my family,
will you, please, sir?

00:49:30.259 --> 00:49:33.353
We'll be waiting for you
when you get back.

00:49:33.554 --> 00:49:37.491
A little older, a little wiser,
but happy to see you.

00:49:40.227 --> 00:49:43.664
Do not go gentle into that good night

00:49:44.031 --> 00:49:48.377
Old age should burn
and rave at close of day

00:49:49.445 --> 00:49:54.508
Rage, rage against
the dying of the light

00:49:55.284 --> 00:49:59.179
Though wise men at their end
Know dark is right

00:49:59.413 --> 00:50:02.391
Because their words had forked
No lightning they

00:50:02.708 --> 00:50:06.353
Do not go gentle into that good night

00:50:06.921 --> 00:50:11.558
Rage, rage against
the dying of the light

00:50:27.858 --> 00:50:29.627
- You good?
- Yeah.

00:50:30.444 --> 00:50:32.046
Okay, thank you, sir.

00:50:35.449 --> 00:50:37.084
Here. Pills.

00:50:39.537 --> 00:50:41.255
So alone.

00:50:41.455 --> 00:50:43.482
We have each other.
Dr. Mann had it worse.

00:50:43.582 --> 00:50:45.025
No, I mean them.

00:50:46.418 --> 00:50:49.813
It's a perfect planet,
and we won't find another one like her.

00:50:50.297 --> 00:50:53.651
No, it's not like looking
for a new condo.

00:50:54.677 --> 00:50:56.945
The human race is going to be...

00:50:57.146 --> 00:50:58.456
adrift...

00:50:58.556 --> 00:51:02.159
desperate for a rock it can cling to
while it catches its breath.

00:51:02.643 --> 00:51:04.578
We need to find that rock.

00:51:04.812 --> 00:51:09.667
And our three prospects are at the edge
of what might sustain human life.

00:51:10.067 --> 00:51:12.595
Laura Miller's planet is first.

00:51:12.695 --> 00:51:14.922
- Laura started our biology program.
- COOPER:

00:51:19.827 --> 00:51:23.097
- Wolf Edmunds is here.
- Tell me about Edmunds.

00:51:23.831 --> 00:51:26.884
Oh... Wolf's a particle physicist.

00:51:28.877 --> 00:51:31.313
None of them had families?

00:51:32.256 --> 00:51:35.201
No. No attachments. My father insisted.

00:51:35.301 --> 00:51:38.913
They all knew the odds against
ever seeing another human being again.

00:51:39.013 --> 00:51:41.040
I'm hoping we can surprise
at least three of them.

00:51:41.140 --> 00:51:43.125
- How about Mann?
- Dr. Mann?

00:51:43.225 --> 00:51:45.211
He's remarkable. He's the best of us.

00:51:45.311 --> 00:51:49.757
He inspired 11 people to follow him
on the loneliest journey in human history.

00:51:49.857 --> 00:51:51.509
Scientists, explorers.

00:51:51.609 --> 00:51:55.796
That's what I love.
You know, out there we face great odds.

00:51:56.196 --> 00:51:57.915
Death, but...

00:51:59.366 --> 00:52:00.801
not evil.

00:52:00.993 --> 00:52:02.845
You don't think nature can be evil?

00:52:03.120 --> 00:52:06.089
No. Formidable. Frightening. But...

00:52:06.582 --> 00:52:08.684
...no, not evil.

00:52:09.835 --> 00:52:13.147
Is a lion evil
because it rips a gazelle to shreds?

00:52:13.547 --> 00:52:15.949
Just what we take with us, then.

00:52:16.091 --> 00:52:17.434
Yeah.

00:52:17.551 --> 00:52:19.703
This crew represents
the best of humanity.

00:52:19.803 --> 00:52:21.038
Even me?

00:52:21.138 --> 00:52:23.207
You know what? We agreed, 90 percent.

00:52:23.307 --> 00:52:24.708
There you go.

00:52:24.808 --> 00:52:27.253
- Don't stay up.
- I'll be there in a minute.

00:52:27.353 --> 00:52:31.498
Just remember, Coop,
you are literally wasting your breath.

00:52:38.072 --> 00:52:41.341
Hey, TARS? Let's go over
that trajectory one more time.

00:52:41.575 --> 00:52:43.343
Eight months to Mars.

00:52:43.744 --> 00:52:46.647
Counter-orbital slingshot around.
Fourteen months to Saturn.

00:52:46.747 --> 00:52:48.232
Nothing's changed on that.

00:52:48.332 --> 00:52:50.517
Just let me ask you something.

00:52:52.670 --> 00:52:56.231
- Dr. Brand and Edmunds...
- Why are you whispering? They can't hear you.

00:52:57.591 --> 00:53:00.661
Dr. Brand and Edmunds. They close?

00:53:00.761 --> 00:53:02.246
I wouldn't know.

00:53:02.346 --> 00:53:05.316
Is that 90 percent "wouldn't know"
or 10 percent "wouldn't know"?

00:53:05.416 --> 00:53:08.245
I also have a discretion setting, Cooper.

00:53:10.104 --> 00:53:12.372
But not a poker face, Slick.

00:53:24.618 --> 00:53:26.169
Hey, guys.

00:53:26.286 --> 00:53:29.473
Dad's about to go down for the long nap.

00:53:29.707 --> 00:53:32.401
So I wanted to give you an update.

00:53:34.169 --> 00:53:37.422
The Earth looks amazing from here.

00:53:38.424 --> 00:53:41.327
You can't see any of the dust. Heh.

00:53:42.660 --> 00:53:45.656
I really hope you guys are doing great.

00:53:45.889 --> 00:53:48.598
I know you're gonna get this message.
Professor Brand's assured me that...

00:53:48.698 --> 00:53:50.157
he's gonna get it to you.

00:53:50.686 --> 00:53:52.830
Know that I love you.

00:53:54.148 --> 00:53:56.583
- Is it him?
- I don't think so, Murph.

00:54:03.365 --> 00:54:05.133
You must be Donald.

00:54:07.244 --> 00:54:08.512
Hello, Murph.

00:54:09.163 --> 00:54:11.265
Why are you in my dad's truck?

00:54:11.790 --> 00:54:14.059
He wanted me
to bring it for your brother.

00:54:14.710 --> 00:54:16.979
He sent you a message.

00:54:19.965 --> 00:54:22.034
She's pretty upset with him for leaving.

00:54:22.134 --> 00:54:26.321
If you record any messages,
I can get them to transmit it to Cooper.

00:54:27.306 --> 00:54:30.075
Murph is a bright spark.

00:54:30.976 --> 00:54:33.587
Maybe I should fan the flame.

00:54:33.687 --> 00:54:36.340
She's already making fools
of her teachers.

00:54:36.440 --> 00:54:39.576
So maybe she should come
and make a fool out of you.

00:54:40.360 --> 00:54:43.497
- So where are they?
- Heading for Mars.

00:54:43.906 --> 00:54:47.910
The next time you hear from Cooper,
they'll be coming up on Saturn.

00:55:28.805 --> 00:55:33.013
...administration wants me to repeat
Plant Pathology. Which sucks.

00:55:33.413 --> 00:55:36.725
But they said I could start
Advanced Agriculture a year early.

00:55:38.418 --> 00:55:42.397
All right, I got to go, Dad.
Hope you're safe up there.

00:55:46.343 --> 00:55:47.995
Sorry, Coop.

00:55:48.095 --> 00:55:53.033
I asked Murph to say hi,
but she's as stubborn as her old man.

00:55:53.350 --> 00:55:55.285
I'll try again next time.

00:56:10.200 --> 00:56:11.852
You all right, Rom?

00:56:14.121 --> 00:56:17.891
This gets to me, Cooper. This. This.

00:56:18.292 --> 00:56:21.236
Millimeters of aluminum, that's it,
and then nothing...

00:56:21.336 --> 00:56:25.399
out there for millions of miles
won't kill us in seconds.

00:56:26.216 --> 00:56:28.202
You know that some of the finest...

00:56:28.302 --> 00:56:32.239
solo yachtsmen in the world
don't know how to swim?

00:56:32.723 --> 00:56:35.993
They don't know how.
And if they go overboard, psst, they're done.

00:56:37.644 --> 00:56:39.705
We're explorers, Rom.

00:56:41.148 --> 00:56:44.551
This is our boat. Here.

00:57:11.261 --> 00:57:13.080
This is from the... relay probe?

00:57:13.180 --> 00:57:15.323
It was in orbit around the Wormhole.

00:57:15.724 --> 00:57:18.836
This is the Wormhole,
and every time we'd come around...

00:57:18.936 --> 00:57:22.247
we would receive images
from the other side of the foreign galaxy.

00:57:22.481 --> 00:57:24.675
Oh, yeah.
Like swinging a periscope around.

00:57:24.775 --> 00:57:25.926
Exactly.

00:57:26.026 --> 00:57:30.630
So we got a pretty good idea
what we're gonna find on the other side?

00:57:31.615 --> 00:57:33.050
Navigationally.

00:57:34.409 --> 00:57:38.463
Guys? Looks like we'll be approaching
the Wormhole in about three hours.

00:57:44.544 --> 00:57:45.887
Hey, Coop?

00:57:46.463 --> 00:57:49.533
- Can we stop the spinning?
- Why?

00:57:49.633 --> 00:57:52.269
Because we're close enough
to see it now?

00:57:53.804 --> 00:57:54.997
All right.

00:57:55.097 --> 00:57:56.281
Thanks.

00:58:01.937 --> 00:58:03.964
There, that's it! That's the Wormhole!

00:58:04.064 --> 00:58:07.593
Say it, don't spray it, Rom. It's a sphere.

00:58:07.693 --> 00:58:11.955
Of course it is. What, you...?
You thought it would just be a hole?

00:58:12.864 --> 00:58:16.051
No, it's just that all the illustrations
I've ever seen, they...

00:58:16.493 --> 00:58:19.679
In the illustrations,
they're trying to show you how it works.

00:58:20.288 --> 00:58:24.359
So they say you want to go
from here to there.

00:58:24.459 --> 00:58:26.783
But it's too far, right?

00:58:27.170 --> 00:58:32.067
So a Wormhole bends space like this,
so you can take a shortcut through...

00:58:32.300 --> 00:58:33.952
a higher dimension.

00:58:34.052 --> 00:58:35.612
Okay, so...

00:58:35.846 --> 00:58:38.783
to show that,
they've turned three-dimensional space

00:58:38.883 --> 00:58:43.962
into two dimensions which turns a Wormhole
into two dimensions, a circle.

00:58:44.062 --> 00:58:46.614
What's a circle in three dimensions?

00:58:47.524 --> 00:58:49.126
- A sphere.
- Exactly.

00:58:49.443 --> 00:58:51.044
A spherical hole.

00:58:51.486 --> 00:58:54.422
But who put it there?
Who do we have to thank?

00:58:54.740 --> 00:58:59.511
I'm not thanking anybody until we
get out of here in one piece, Rom.

00:59:06.426 --> 00:59:08.445
Any trick to this, Doyle?

00:59:09.379 --> 00:59:11.148
No one knows.

00:59:18.180 --> 00:59:19.948
The others made it, right?

00:59:21.892 --> 00:59:23.660
At least some of them.

00:59:55.509 --> 00:59:58.778
Everybody ready to say goodbye
to our solar system?

00:59:59.554 --> 01:00:01.656
To our galaxy.

01:00:03.475 --> 01:00:04.618
Here we go.

01:00:37.134 --> 01:00:40.704
The controls won't work here.
We're passing through the bulk.

01:00:40.804 --> 01:00:45.325
It's space beyond our three dimensions.
All you can do is record and observe.

01:00:56.403 --> 01:00:57.545
What is that?

01:00:59.823 --> 01:01:03.927
- I think it's them.
- Distorting space-time.

01:01:05.912 --> 01:01:07.097
Don't! Don't!

01:01:35.025 --> 01:01:36.576
What was that?

01:01:39.279 --> 01:01:40.880
The first handshake.

01:01:42.449 --> 01:01:43.891
We're...

01:01:45.118 --> 01:01:46.753
We're here.

01:02:06.806 --> 01:02:09.126
So the lost communications came through.

01:02:09.226 --> 01:02:12.170
- How?
- The relay on this side cached them.

01:02:12.270 --> 01:02:15.915
So years of basic data.
No real surprises.

01:02:16.733 --> 01:02:20.437
Miller's site has kept pinging thumbs up,
as has Dr. Mann's.

01:02:20.537 --> 01:02:22.931
Edmunds' went down three years ago.

01:02:23.031 --> 01:02:24.307
Transmitter failure?

01:02:24.407 --> 01:02:27.477
Maybe. He was sending the thumbs up
right until it went dark.

01:02:27.577 --> 01:02:29.396
But Miller's still
looks good though, right?

01:02:29.496 --> 01:02:31.890
- Because she's coming up fast.
- DOYLE:

01:02:32.249 --> 01:02:34.351
With one complication.

01:02:34.668 --> 01:02:37.737
The planet is much closer to Gargantua
than we thought.

01:02:37.837 --> 01:02:40.574
- Gargantua?
- It's what we're calling the black hole.

01:02:40.674 --> 01:02:43.034
Miller's and Dr. Mann's planets
both orbit it.

01:02:43.134 --> 01:02:46.413
- And Miller's is on the horizon?
- As a basketball around a hoop.

01:02:46.513 --> 01:02:48.582
Landing there takes us
dangerously close.

01:02:48.682 --> 01:02:52.035
And a black hole that big
has a huge gravitational pull.

01:02:54.521 --> 01:02:57.591
Look, I could swing around
that neutron star to decelerate.

01:02:57.691 --> 01:02:59.434
No, it's not that. It's time.

01:02:59.534 --> 01:03:04.339
The gravity on that planet will slow
our clock compared to Earth's drastically.

01:03:04.864 --> 01:03:06.099
How bad?

01:03:06.199 --> 01:03:09.844
Every hour we spend
on that planet will be...

01:03:10.620 --> 01:03:12.889
seven years back on Earth.

01:03:13.665 --> 01:03:14.808
Jesus.

01:03:15.041 --> 01:03:16.810
Well, that's relativity, folks.

01:03:18.128 --> 01:03:20.655
Well, we can't just drop down
there without...

01:03:20.755 --> 01:03:22.699
Cooper, we have a mission.

01:03:22.799 --> 01:03:25.452
Yeah, Doyle, we have a mission,
and our mission Plan A is...

01:03:25.552 --> 01:03:28.788
to find a planet that can habitate
the people that are living on Earth right now.

01:03:28.888 --> 01:03:31.791
You can't just think about your family.
Now you have to think bigger than that.

01:03:31.891 --> 01:03:34.970
I am thinking about my family
and millions of other families, okay?

01:03:35.070 --> 01:03:39.624
Plan A does not work if the people on Earth
are dead by the time we pull it off.

01:03:40.717 --> 01:03:44.587
No. It doesn't.
That's why there's a Plan B.

01:03:46.406 --> 01:03:49.449
Okay. Cooper's right.
We need to think of time as a resource,

01:03:49.549 --> 01:03:52.011
just like oxygen and food.
Going down it's gonna cost us.

01:03:54.289 --> 01:03:55.957
All right, look.

01:03:56.750 --> 01:04:00.278
Dr. Mann's data is promising,
but it's gonna take months to get there.

01:04:00.378 --> 01:04:02.656
And Edmunds', it's even further.

01:04:02.756 --> 01:04:06.993
Miller hasn't sent much, but what she has
is very promising. It's water, it's organics...

01:04:07.093 --> 01:04:09.329
- You don't find that every day.
- No, you don't.

01:04:09.429 --> 01:04:11.831
And just think about the resources,
including time...

01:04:11.931 --> 01:04:14.534
that would be spent
trying to get back here.

01:04:15.560 --> 01:04:17.020
- Romilly...
- Yeah?

01:04:17.120 --> 01:04:21.424
...how far off from Miller's planet do we
have to be to stay out of the time shift?

01:04:21.524 --> 01:04:23.260
Just back from the cusp.

01:04:23.360 --> 01:04:26.388
All right, which is here,
just outside of Miller's planet.

01:04:26.488 --> 01:04:28.381
- Right.
- Okay.

01:04:29.199 --> 01:04:32.060
Here's Gargantua.
Here's Miller's planet.

01:04:32.160 --> 01:04:35.397
Instead of taking the Endurance
into orbit around Miller's planet...

01:04:35.497 --> 01:04:38.441
which would conserve fuel,
but we would lose a lot of time...

01:04:38.541 --> 01:04:41.709
what if we take a wider orbit
around Gargantua,

01:04:41.809 --> 01:04:45.365
parallel with Miller's planet
outside of this time shift, to here?

01:04:45.465 --> 01:04:48.326
Then we take the Ranger down,
we get Miller, we get her samples.

01:04:48.426 --> 01:04:51.204
We come back, we analyze, we debrief.
We're in, we're out.

01:04:51.304 --> 01:04:53.707
We lose a little fuel,
but we save a whole lot of time.

01:04:53.807 --> 01:04:55.509
- That'll work.
- That's good.

01:04:55.609 --> 01:04:58.136
There's no time for monkey business
or chit-chat down there.

01:04:58.236 --> 01:05:01.098
So, TARS,
you should definitely stay here.

01:05:01.198 --> 01:05:03.717
CASE, you're with me.
Anyone else can stay.

01:05:03.817 --> 01:05:07.935
If we're talking about a couple years,
I could use the time to research gravity.

01:05:08.035 --> 01:05:10.598
Observations from the Wormhole,
that's gold to Professor Brand.

01:05:10.698 --> 01:05:12.434
TARS, factor an orbit of Gargantua.

01:05:12.534 --> 01:05:17.355
Conserve fuel, minimize thrusting,
but make sure we stay in range of Miller's planet.

01:05:17.455 --> 01:05:20.066
- You got it?
- I wouldn't leave you behind...

01:05:20.166 --> 01:05:21.309
Dr. Brand.

01:05:25.880 --> 01:05:27.607
- You ready, CASE?
- Yup.

01:05:28.466 --> 01:05:32.070
- You don't say much, do you?
- TARS talks plenty for both of us.

01:05:33.179 --> 01:05:34.322
Detach.

01:05:41.521 --> 01:05:44.582
- Romilly, are you reading these forces?
- It's unbelievable.

01:05:47.694 --> 01:05:50.221
A literal heart of darkness.

01:05:53.992 --> 01:05:56.770
If we could just see
the collapsed star inside...

01:05:56.870 --> 01:05:59.722
the singularity, yeah,
we'd solve gravity.

01:06:00.039 --> 01:06:03.401
- And we can't get anything from it?
- Nothing escapes that horizon.

01:06:03.501 --> 01:06:04.903
Not even light.

01:06:05.003 --> 01:06:08.606
- The answer's there, just no way to see it.
- There's Miller's planet.

01:06:11.176 --> 01:06:13.210
Goodbye, Ranger.

01:06:25.315 --> 01:06:27.675
This is fast for atmospheric entry.

01:06:27.775 --> 01:06:30.128
- Should we use the thrusters to slow?
- No.

01:06:30.487 --> 01:06:33.890
I'm gonna use the Ranger's aerodynamics
to save some fuel.

01:06:33.990 --> 01:06:35.266
Air brake?

01:06:35.366 --> 01:06:38.978
- We want to get down fast, don't we?
- We want to get there in one piece.

01:06:39.078 --> 01:06:42.181
- Hang on.
- Brand, Doyle, get ready.

01:06:57.931 --> 01:07:00.500
- We should ease!
- Hands where I can see them.

01:07:00.600 --> 01:07:04.003
The only time I went down was
when a machine was easing at the wrong time.

01:07:04.103 --> 01:07:07.006
- A little caution...
- Can get you killed, like reckless driving.

01:07:07.106 --> 01:07:09.375
- Cooper, it's too damn fast!
- I got this.

01:07:14.113 --> 01:07:18.217
- Should I disable the feedback?
- No. I need to feel the air.

01:07:22.321 --> 01:07:23.589
Here we go.

01:07:26.584 --> 01:07:27.977
It's just water!

01:07:29.379 --> 01:07:30.980
The stuff of life.

01:07:31.339 --> 01:07:32.824
Twelve hundred meters.

01:07:32.924 --> 01:07:35.034
- Do we have a fix on the beacon?
- Got it!

01:07:35.134 --> 01:07:37.829
- Can you maneuver?
- I'll need to shave some speed.

01:07:37.929 --> 01:07:40.657
I'm gonna spiral down on top of it.
Everybody hang on!

01:07:42.976 --> 01:07:44.118
Seven hundred.

01:07:46.145 --> 01:07:48.247
On my cue, CASE. On my cue.

01:07:51.651 --> 01:07:53.252
Five hundred meters.

01:08:02.620 --> 01:08:03.763
Fire!

01:08:17.218 --> 01:08:19.654
- Very graceful.
- No.

01:08:20.179 --> 01:08:23.365
But very efficient.

01:08:24.726 --> 01:08:27.003
What are you waiting for? Let's go!

01:08:27.103 --> 01:08:29.122
Go, go, go!

01:08:29.239 --> 01:08:32.792
Seven years per hour here.
Let's make it count!

01:08:58.801 --> 01:09:00.153
This way.

01:09:02.889 --> 01:09:04.741
About 200 meters.

01:09:14.150 --> 01:09:16.277
The gravity's punishing.

01:09:16.736 --> 01:09:18.930
Been floating through space too long?

01:09:19.030 --> 01:09:21.307
110% Earth gravity.

01:09:21.407 --> 01:09:23.709
Come on. Come on.

01:09:26.037 --> 01:09:28.973
- There's nothing here.
- Should be right here.

01:09:30.792 --> 01:09:34.095
If the signal's
coming from here, then...

01:09:43.429 --> 01:09:45.097
Her beacon.

01:09:52.730 --> 01:09:53.873
Wreckage.

01:09:54.440 --> 01:09:55.708
Where's the rest?

01:09:56.109 --> 01:09:57.710
Towards the mountains!

01:10:01.447 --> 01:10:03.382
Those aren't mountains.

01:10:04.951 --> 01:10:06.385
They're waves.

01:10:11.624 --> 01:10:14.393
Oh, shit. Oh, shit. Oh, shit.

01:10:14.794 --> 01:10:16.896
That one's moving away from us.

01:10:23.302 --> 01:10:25.071
We need the recorder.

01:10:35.148 --> 01:10:37.467
Brand, Doyle, back to the Ranger now!

01:10:37.567 --> 01:10:41.012
We're not leaving without her data.

01:10:41.112 --> 01:10:44.390
Get back here now! We do not have time!

01:10:44.490 --> 01:10:47.051
The second wave is coming!
We're in the middle of a swell.

01:10:48.244 --> 01:10:49.729
No, I got it.

01:10:49.829 --> 01:10:51.931
Get your ass back to the Ranger now!

01:10:56.836 --> 01:10:58.980
Brand, get back here now!

01:11:00.840 --> 01:11:03.150
No, Cooper, go.
Cooper, go. I can't make it.

01:11:03.468 --> 01:11:05.945
- Go!
- CASE, go get her.

01:11:10.641 --> 01:11:12.743
- Go!
- Get up. Get up, Brand!

01:11:13.561 --> 01:11:15.162
Go, go! Go!

01:11:16.647 --> 01:11:19.584
- I'm not gonna make it!
- Yes, you are. Yes, you are!

01:11:26.324 --> 01:11:28.718
Come on, CASE has her!
Get back here, Doyle!

01:11:31.621 --> 01:11:33.005
Come on!

01:11:35.458 --> 01:11:36.976
Get to the hatch!

01:11:41.422 --> 01:11:43.024
Go, go! Go!

01:11:48.471 --> 01:11:49.655
Shit.

01:11:50.056 --> 01:11:51.991
Manually overriding inside hatch!

01:11:55.394 --> 01:11:56.662
Cooper! Wait!

01:12:03.903 --> 01:12:07.673
The engines are flooded!
I'm gonna have to shut her down.

01:12:41.023 --> 01:12:42.458
Holy shit.

01:12:46.779 --> 01:12:48.214
Hang on!

01:13:19.353 --> 01:13:23.290
- CASE, what's the problem?
- Too waterlogged. Let it drain.

01:13:24.317 --> 01:13:25.593
Goddamn it!

01:13:25.693 --> 01:13:30.431
- I told you to leave me! Why didn't you?
- And I told you to get your ass back here!

01:13:30.531 --> 01:13:35.302
- One of us was thinking about the mission!
- You were thinking about getting home.

01:13:37.038 --> 01:13:39.440
I was trying to do the right thing!

01:13:39.540 --> 01:13:41.600
Can you tell that to Doyle?

01:13:43.594 --> 01:13:46.063
- CASE, how much time?
- Forty-five to an hour.

01:13:47.757 --> 01:13:51.545
The stuff of life?
What's this gonna cost us, Brand?

01:13:52.345 --> 01:13:54.372
A lot. Decades.

01:14:01.520 --> 01:14:02.955
What happened to Miller?

01:14:03.606 --> 01:14:09.220
Judging by the wreckage, she was
broken up by a wave soon after impact.

01:14:09.320 --> 01:14:12.256
How's the wreckage stayed together
after all these years?

01:14:13.407 --> 01:14:15.709
Because of the time slippage.

01:14:16.535 --> 01:14:21.140
On this planet's time,
she just landed hours ago.

01:14:21.958 --> 01:14:24.402
She probably just died minutes ago.

01:14:24.502 --> 01:14:28.647
The data Doyle received was just
the initial status echoing endlessly.

01:14:28.923 --> 01:14:31.192
Oh, we are not prepared for this.

01:14:33.469 --> 01:14:36.998
You eggheads have the survival skills
of a Boy Scout troop.

01:14:37.098 --> 01:14:40.418
Well, we got this far on our brains.
Farther than any human in history.

01:14:40.518 --> 01:14:42.336
Well, not far enough!

01:14:42.436 --> 01:14:46.040
And now we're stuck here till there
won't be anyone left on Earth to save.

01:14:48.985 --> 01:14:51.754
I'm counting every minute,
same as you, Cooper.

01:14:56.450 --> 01:14:58.352
Is there any possibility...

01:14:58.452 --> 01:15:02.148
I don't know, some kind of a way
we can maybe all jump in a black hole?

01:15:02.248 --> 01:15:04.016
Gain back the years?

01:15:04.583 --> 01:15:06.152
Don't shake your head at me.

01:15:06.252 --> 01:15:08.321
Time is relative, okay?

01:15:08.421 --> 01:15:11.565
It can stretch
and it can squeeze, but...

01:15:11.966 --> 01:15:14.243
it can't run backwards. It just can't.

01:15:14.343 --> 01:15:18.864
The only thing that can move across
dimensions, like time, is gravity.

01:15:21.475 --> 01:15:22.943
Okay.

01:15:24.603 --> 01:15:28.549
The beings that led us here,
they communicate...

01:15:28.649 --> 01:15:30.551
- ...through gravity, right?
- Yes.

01:15:30.651 --> 01:15:32.920
Could they be talking to us
from the future?

01:15:33.738 --> 01:15:36.090
- Maybe.
- Okay. If they can...

01:15:37.199 --> 01:15:40.553
"They" are beings of five dimensions.

01:15:40.870 --> 01:15:44.306
To them, time might be
another physical dimension.

01:15:44.540 --> 01:15:45.975
To them...

01:15:46.292 --> 01:15:50.529
the past might be a canyon
that they can climb into and the future...

01:15:50.629 --> 01:15:53.732
a mountain they can climb up.
But to us, it's not, okay?

01:15:54.717 --> 01:15:58.236
Look, Cooper, I screwed up. I'm sorry.

01:15:59.305 --> 01:16:02.658
- But you knew about relativity.
- Oh.

01:16:04.268 --> 01:16:05.936
Brand...

01:16:10.316 --> 01:16:12.535
my daughter was 10 years old.

01:16:12.860 --> 01:16:15.754
I couldn't teach her
Einstein's theories before I left.

01:16:16.072 --> 01:16:19.008
Couldn't you have told her
you were going to save the world?

01:16:19.492 --> 01:16:21.034
No.

01:16:22.203 --> 01:16:26.673
When you become a parent,
one thing becomes really clear.

01:16:27.875 --> 01:16:31.145
And that is that you want to make sure
your children feel safe.

01:16:32.088 --> 01:16:36.241
And it rules out telling a 10-year-old
that the world is ending.

01:16:38.202 --> 01:16:39.778
Cooper?

01:16:43.390 --> 01:16:45.960
- How long for the engines, CASE?
- A minute or two.

01:16:46.060 --> 01:16:48.245
We don't have it. Helmets on!

01:16:52.066 --> 01:16:53.926
Brand, co-pilot, you're up.

01:16:54.026 --> 01:16:56.595
CASE, blow the cabin oxygen
through the main thrusters!

01:16:56.695 --> 01:16:58.505
- We're gonna spark it.
- Roger that.

01:16:58.697 --> 01:17:00.132
- Locked.
- Depressurizing.

01:17:05.913 --> 01:17:07.264
Engines up!

01:17:36.026 --> 01:17:37.628
Hello, Rom.

01:17:37.987 --> 01:17:39.955
I've waited years.

01:17:40.739 --> 01:17:43.275
How...? How many years?

01:17:44.410 --> 01:17:47.438
- By now it must be...
- Twenty-three years...

01:17:47.538 --> 01:17:49.548
four months, eight days.

01:17:53.669 --> 01:17:55.337
Doyle?

01:18:01.051 --> 01:18:04.254
I thought I was prepared.
I knew the theory.

01:18:05.431 --> 01:18:07.032
Reality's different.

01:18:07.975 --> 01:18:09.744
And Miller?

01:18:10.728 --> 01:18:12.830
There's nothing here for us.

01:18:15.582 --> 01:18:17.084
Why didn't you sleep?

01:18:17.943 --> 01:18:22.131
Oh, I had a couple of stretches.
But I stopped believing you were coming back.

01:18:22.531 --> 01:18:25.634
And something seemed wrong
about dreaming my life away.

01:18:26.368 --> 01:18:29.305
I learned what I could
from the black hole...

01:18:29.580 --> 01:18:32.108
but I couldn't send anything
to your father.

01:18:32.208 --> 01:18:34.527
We've been receiving,
but nothing gets out.

01:18:34.627 --> 01:18:37.012
- Is he alive?
- Oh, yeah.

01:18:37.129 --> 01:18:39.323
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

01:18:41.926 --> 01:18:45.029
We've got years of messages stored.

01:18:45.221 --> 01:18:46.455
Cooper.

01:18:46.555 --> 01:18:49.858
Messages span 23 years.

01:18:51.602 --> 01:18:53.370
Play it from the beginning.

01:18:56.315 --> 01:18:58.325
Hey, Dad.

01:18:58.859 --> 01:19:01.578
Checking in. Saying hi.

01:19:04.031 --> 01:19:06.124
Finished second in school.

01:19:07.409 --> 01:19:10.020
Miss Kurling's still
giving me C's though.

01:19:10.120 --> 01:19:13.257
Pulled me down, but seconds not bad.

01:19:14.124 --> 01:19:16.693
Grandpa attended the ceremony.

01:19:17.920 --> 01:19:20.022
Oh.

01:19:20.881 --> 01:19:22.908
I met another girl, Dad.

01:19:23.008 --> 01:19:24.893
I...

01:19:25.344 --> 01:19:27.646
I really think this is the one.

01:19:28.639 --> 01:19:31.925
Name's Lois. That's her right there.

01:19:34.270 --> 01:19:36.772
Murphy stole Grandpa's car.

01:19:36.939 --> 01:19:40.008
She crashed it. She's okay, though.

01:19:40.276 --> 01:19:41.760
Hey, Dad.

01:19:42.278 --> 01:19:43.912
Look at this!

01:19:44.446 --> 01:19:46.248
You're a grandpa.

01:19:47.366 --> 01:19:49.334
His name's Jesse.

01:19:49.702 --> 01:19:54.857
I kind of wanted to call him Coop,
but Lois says... maybe next time.

01:19:54.957 --> 01:19:59.478
Donald says he's already earned
the "great" part, so we just leave it at that.

01:20:02.548 --> 01:20:04.441
Oh, dear. Oh, dear.

01:20:05.134 --> 01:20:09.071
Say "Bye-bye, Grandpa."
Bye-bye, Grandpa. Okay.

01:20:09.388 --> 01:20:11.990
Sorry it's been a while.

01:20:13.267 --> 01:20:14.910
Just...

01:20:16.520 --> 01:20:18.922
what with Jesse and all.

01:20:25.029 --> 01:20:27.664
Grandpa died last week.

01:20:27.781 --> 01:20:31.368
We buried him out in the back forty
next to Mom and...

01:20:31.744 --> 01:20:33.428
Jesse.

01:20:33.704 --> 01:20:37.290
Which is where we would have buried you
if you'd ever...

01:20:37.541 --> 01:20:39.643
come back.

01:20:40.544 --> 01:20:43.096
Murph was there at the funeral.

01:20:43.422 --> 01:20:46.375
We don't see her that much,
but she came for that.

01:20:49.386 --> 01:20:52.405
You aren't listening to this,
I know that.

01:20:54.933 --> 01:20:57.786
All these messages are just, like...

01:20:58.854 --> 01:21:03.024
drifting out there in the darkness.

01:21:03.609 --> 01:21:06.044
Lois says that...

01:21:06.737 --> 01:21:09.765
I have to let you go.

01:21:09.865 --> 01:21:11.800
And...

01:21:12.201 --> 01:21:13.885
So...

01:21:16.538 --> 01:21:19.825
I guess I'm letting you go.

01:21:20.584 --> 01:21:23.753
I don't know where you are, Dad...

01:21:23.879 --> 01:21:26.807
but I hope that you're at peace.

01:21:28.300 --> 01:21:29.685
Goodbye.

01:21:42.981 --> 01:21:44.633
Hey, Dad.

01:21:47.069 --> 01:21:48.304
Hey, Murph.

01:21:48.404 --> 01:21:50.822
You son of a bitch.

01:21:54.034 --> 01:21:56.603
I never made one of these
when you were still responding...

01:21:56.703 --> 01:21:59.339
because I was so mad at you for leaving.

01:22:02.084 --> 01:22:04.569
And then when you went quiet, it...

01:22:06.797 --> 01:22:10.233
seemed like I should live with that decision.
And I have.

01:22:14.138 --> 01:22:16.857
But today's my birthday.

01:22:20.227 --> 01:22:23.897
And it's a special one,
because you told me...

01:22:27.526 --> 01:22:32.164
You once told me that when you came back,
we might be the same age.

01:22:33.574 --> 01:22:36.960
And today I'm the age you were
when you left.

01:22:39.663 --> 01:22:41.815
So it would be a real good time
for you to come back.

01:22:56.221 --> 01:23:00.617
I didn't mean to intrude. It's just that
I've never seen you in here before.

01:23:01.143 --> 01:23:03.412
I've never been in here before.

01:23:05.189 --> 01:23:10.427
I talk to Amelia all the time. It helps.

01:23:10.694 --> 01:23:13.514
- I'm glad you've started.
- I haven't. I...

01:23:13.614 --> 01:23:16.216
I just had something
I needed to get out.

01:23:16.450 --> 01:23:18.936
- I know they're still out there.
- I know.

01:23:19.036 --> 01:23:23.315
There are so many reasons their
communications might not be getting through.

01:23:23.415 --> 01:23:24.933
I know, professor.

01:23:25.459 --> 01:23:28.478
I'm not sure what I'm more afraid of.

01:23:29.546 --> 01:23:32.382
Them never coming back or...

01:23:33.091 --> 01:23:36.370
coming back to find we've failed.

01:23:36.470 --> 01:23:37.988
Then let's succeed.

01:23:38.931 --> 01:23:40.473
So...

01:23:40.682 --> 01:23:44.920
back to the fourth iteration.
Let's run it through some new fields.

01:23:45.020 --> 01:23:48.424
With respect, professor,
we've tried that hundreds of times.

01:23:48.524 --> 01:23:52.694
It only has to work once, Murph.

01:23:55.489 --> 01:23:59.435
Every rivet that they strike
could have been a bullet.

01:23:59.535 --> 01:24:01.603
We've done well for the world here...

01:24:01.703 --> 01:24:06.525
whether or not we crack the equation
before I kick the bucket.

01:24:06.625 --> 01:24:09.603
- Don't be morbid, professor.
- I'm not afraid of death.

01:24:10.254 --> 01:24:12.589
I'm an old physicist.

01:24:13.340 --> 01:24:15.108
I'm afraid of time.

01:24:22.182 --> 01:24:23.450
Time.

01:24:25.394 --> 01:24:27.162
You're afraid of time.

01:24:29.648 --> 01:24:31.717
We've been trying
to solve the equation...

01:24:31.817 --> 01:24:34.386
without changing
the underlying assumption about time.

01:24:34.486 --> 01:24:36.263
- And?
- And that means...

01:24:36.363 --> 01:24:40.893
each iteration is an attempt
to prove its own proof.

01:24:40.993 --> 01:24:43.312
It's recursive. It's nonsensical.

01:24:43.412 --> 01:24:47.274
Are you calling my life's work...
nonsense, Murph?

01:24:47.374 --> 01:24:49.285
No, I'm saying
that you've been trying to...

01:24:49.385 --> 01:24:53.680
finish it with one arm...
No, with both arms tied behind your back.

01:24:55.465 --> 01:24:57.867
And I don't understand why.

01:24:58.427 --> 01:25:00.662
I'm an old man, Murph.

01:25:01.179 --> 01:25:03.874
Can we take this point up
at another time?

01:25:03.974 --> 01:25:06.401
I want to talk to my daughter.

01:25:08.270 --> 01:25:10.797
Stepping out into the universe...

01:25:10.897 --> 01:25:14.793
we must confront the reality
of interstellar travel.

01:25:15.611 --> 01:25:20.224
We must reach far beyond
our own lifespans.

01:25:20.324 --> 01:25:25.854
We must think not as individuals
but as a species.

01:25:28.290 --> 01:25:31.617
Do not go gentle into that good night

01:25:33.086 --> 01:25:35.739
TARS kept the Endurance
right where we needed her.

01:25:35.839 --> 01:25:38.734
But the trip took years longer
than we anticipated.

01:25:38.967 --> 01:25:42.571
We no longer have the fuel
to visit both prospects, so...

01:25:42.804 --> 01:25:44.606
we have to choose.

01:25:45.515 --> 01:25:46.942
But how?

01:25:47.684 --> 01:25:49.653
They're both promising.

01:25:50.896 --> 01:25:55.467
Edmunds' data is better, but Dr. Mann
is the one still transmitting, so...

01:25:55.567 --> 01:25:58.787
We've no reason to suspect
Edmunds's data would have soured.

01:25:59.404 --> 01:26:01.974
His world has key elements
to sustain human life.

01:26:02.074 --> 01:26:05.543
- As does Dr. Mann's.
- Cooper, this is my field.

01:26:06.411 --> 01:26:07.754
And...

01:26:08.246 --> 01:26:10.482
I really believe Edmunds'
is the better prospect.

01:26:10.582 --> 01:26:14.219
- Why?
- Gargantua, that's why.

01:26:15.045 --> 01:26:19.157
Look at Miller's planet.
Hydrocarbons, organics, yes...

01:26:19.257 --> 01:26:23.979
but no life. Sterile.
We'll find the same thing on Mann's.

01:26:24.096 --> 01:26:25.956
Because of the black hole?

01:26:26.056 --> 01:26:29.167
Murphy's Law.
Whatever can happen will happen.

01:26:29.267 --> 01:26:31.670
Accident is the first building block
of evolution.

01:26:31.770 --> 01:26:34.673
But when you're orbiting a black hole
not enough can happen.

01:26:34.773 --> 01:26:39.344
It sucks in asteroids and comets,
other events which would otherwise reach you.

01:26:39.444 --> 01:26:41.579
We need to go further afield.

01:26:41.905 --> 01:26:44.541
You once said that Dr. Mann...

01:26:45.492 --> 01:26:47.185
was the best of us.

01:26:47.285 --> 01:26:50.755
He's remarkable.
We're only here because of him.

01:26:50.997 --> 01:26:52.899
And yet... Yet here he is.

01:26:52.999 --> 01:26:57.285
He's on the ground, and he's sending
a very unambiguous message,

01:26:57.385 --> 01:26:59.906
telling us to come to his planet.

01:27:00.006 --> 01:27:04.936
Granted, but Edmunds' data
is more promising.

01:27:05.095 --> 01:27:06.204
We should vote.

01:27:06.304 --> 01:27:08.773
Well, if we vote,
there's something you should know.

01:27:09.599 --> 01:27:12.777
Brand? He has a right to know.

01:27:12.978 --> 01:27:14.796
That has nothing to do with it.

01:27:14.896 --> 01:27:18.008
- What does?
- She's in love with Wolf Edmunds.

01:27:18.108 --> 01:27:21.152
- Is that true?
- Yes.

01:27:23.822 --> 01:27:26.833
And that makes me
want to follow my heart.

01:27:29.995 --> 01:27:33.732
But maybe we've spent too long trying
to figure all this out with theory.

01:27:33.832 --> 01:27:35.317
You're a scientist, Brand.

01:27:35.417 --> 01:27:37.260
So listen to me...

01:27:37.794 --> 01:27:42.807
when I say that love
isn't something we invented. It's...

01:27:43.508 --> 01:27:46.144
observable, powerful.

01:27:47.929 --> 01:27:49.606
It has to mean something.

01:27:49.706 --> 01:27:54.052
Love has meaning, yes. Social utility,
social bonding, child rearing...

01:27:54.152 --> 01:27:57.956
We love people who have died.
Where's the social utility in that?

01:27:58.398 --> 01:27:59.508
None.

01:27:59.608 --> 01:28:03.553
Maybe it means something more,
something we can't...

01:28:03.653 --> 01:28:05.764
yet understand.

01:28:05.864 --> 01:28:09.626
Maybe it's some evidence, some...

01:28:10.285 --> 01:28:14.815
artifact of a higher dimension
that we can't consciously perceive.

01:28:14.915 --> 01:28:19.778
I'm drawn across the universe
to someone I haven't seen in a decade...

01:28:19.878 --> 01:28:22.948
who I know is probably dead.

01:28:23.048 --> 01:28:26.451
Love is the one thing
we're capable of perceiving...

01:28:26.551 --> 01:28:29.687
that transcends dimensions
of time and space.

01:28:31.223 --> 01:28:35.860
Maybe we should trust that,
even if we can't understand it yet.

01:28:40.565 --> 01:28:42.534
All right, Cooper...

01:28:44.110 --> 01:28:45.703
yes...

01:28:46.571 --> 01:28:50.108
the tiniest possibility
of seeing Wolf again excites me.

01:28:50.742 --> 01:28:52.710
That doesn't mean I'm wrong.

01:28:53.119 --> 01:28:55.588
Honestly, Amelia...

01:28:57.082 --> 01:28:58.350
it might.

01:29:05.048 --> 01:29:08.059
TARS, chart a course for Dr. Mann's.

01:29:24.851 --> 01:29:28.121
We'll lose about a third again.
But next year...

01:29:30.115 --> 01:29:33.051
Next year I'm gonna work Nelson's farm
and we'll make it up.

01:29:33.785 --> 01:29:35.920
What happened to Nelson?

01:29:41.543 --> 01:29:43.820
Murph, have you eaten enough?
Would you like some more souffle?

01:29:43.920 --> 01:29:47.599
Oh, no. I'm full, thanks.
It was delicious.

01:29:48.174 --> 01:29:50.476
Coop, finish your fritter, please.

01:29:52.345 --> 01:29:56.124
Will you spend the night? Your room
is exactly as you left it. It's ready.

01:29:56.224 --> 01:29:57.667
I need to get back.

01:29:57.767 --> 01:29:59.578
My sewing machine is in there,
but there's plenty...

01:29:59.678 --> 01:30:02.071
I need to...

01:30:04.649 --> 01:30:06.692
Too many memories.

01:30:06.818 --> 01:30:09.713
We might have something for that.
Hey, Coop.

01:30:17.162 --> 01:30:18.555
The dust.

01:30:20.957 --> 01:30:23.401
Lois, I have a friend who...

01:30:23.801 --> 01:30:25.637
could look at his lungs.

01:30:43.521 --> 01:30:46.258
- Amelia, I'm sorry.
- You were just being objective.

01:30:46.358 --> 01:30:49.886
Unless you're punishing me
for screwing up on Miller's planet.

01:30:49.986 --> 01:30:52.538
No, this wasn't a personal decision.

01:30:53.073 --> 01:30:57.185
If you're wrong, you will have
a very personal decision to make.

01:30:57.285 --> 01:31:00.480
Your fuel calculations
are based on a return journey.

01:31:00.580 --> 01:31:04.651
Strike out on Mann's planet, and we'll have
to decide whether to return home...

01:31:04.751 --> 01:31:07.112
or push on to Edmunds' with Plan B.

01:31:07.212 --> 01:31:11.116
Starting a colony could save us
from extinction.

01:31:11.216 --> 01:31:14.452
You might have to decide
between seeing your children again...

01:31:14.552 --> 01:31:16.488
and the future of the human race.

01:31:17.689 --> 01:31:19.699
I trust you'll be as objective then.

01:31:26.481 --> 01:31:28.466
He's been asking for you
since he came to.

01:31:28.566 --> 01:31:30.293
We were trying to reach you.

01:31:36.157 --> 01:31:37.500
Murph.

01:31:38.201 --> 01:31:40.003
I'm here, professor.

01:31:40.412 --> 01:31:42.781
I let you all down.

01:31:43.081 --> 01:31:46.718
No, you got us so far. Real close.

01:31:48.253 --> 01:31:50.113
I'll finish what you started.

01:31:50.213 --> 01:31:52.724
Good, good Murph.

01:31:54.718 --> 01:31:57.312
You had faith...

01:31:58.221 --> 01:31:59.814
all those...

01:32:00.473 --> 01:32:02.567
all those years.

01:32:03.935 --> 01:32:05.253
I...

01:32:05.353 --> 01:32:08.156
I asked you to have faith.

01:32:09.607 --> 01:32:12.702
I wanted you to believe...

01:32:13.903 --> 01:32:16.080
that your father...

01:32:18.783 --> 01:32:20.685
would come back.

01:32:20.785 --> 01:32:22.078
I do, professor.

01:32:23.705 --> 01:32:27.959
- Forgive me, Murph.
- There's nothing to forgive.

01:32:31.028 --> 01:32:34.390
I... I lied, Murph.

01:32:36.468 --> 01:32:38.561
I lied to you.

01:32:44.601 --> 01:32:47.912
There was no need for him to...

01:32:49.022 --> 01:32:51.199
To come back.

01:32:53.485 --> 01:32:57.121
There is no way to help us.

01:32:58.114 --> 01:32:59.457
But Plan A...

01:32:59.699 --> 01:33:03.127
All this. All these people.

01:33:03.953 --> 01:33:06.048
And the equation.

01:33:09.751 --> 01:33:11.603
Did my father know?

01:33:15.298 --> 01:33:17.508
Did he leave me?

01:33:20.970 --> 01:33:22.313
Do...

01:33:23.181 --> 01:33:24.816
not...

01:33:25.475 --> 01:33:27.026
go...

01:33:27.936 --> 01:33:30.021
gentle...

01:33:31.523 --> 01:33:32.990
No.

01:33:34.359 --> 01:33:35.943
No!

01:33:36.653 --> 01:33:38.596
You can't leave.

01:33:38.696 --> 01:33:40.248
You... No.

01:33:41.032 --> 01:33:46.003
Dr. Brand, I'm sorry to tell you
that your father died today. He had no pain.

01:33:46.187 --> 01:33:48.356
He was at peace.

01:33:48.623 --> 01:33:51.008
I'm very sorry for your loss.

01:34:03.304 --> 01:34:05.073
Brand, did you know?

01:34:07.392 --> 01:34:09.360
He told you, right?

01:34:11.938 --> 01:34:13.814
You knew.

01:34:15.233 --> 01:34:17.326
This was all a sham.

01:34:21.406 --> 01:34:23.591
You left us here.

01:34:25.243 --> 01:34:27.044
To suffocate.

01:34:28.913 --> 01:34:30.548
To starve.

01:34:57.609 --> 01:34:59.043
Frozen cloud.

01:37:23.379 --> 01:37:26.641
It's okay. It's okay.

01:37:33.181 --> 01:37:34.982
It's okay.

01:37:40.104 --> 01:37:42.406
Pray you never learn...

01:37:43.274 --> 01:37:46.911
just how good it can be
to see another face.

01:37:55.036 --> 01:37:57.605
I hadn't a lot of hope
to begin with, but...

01:37:57.705 --> 01:38:00.341
after so long, I had none.

01:38:01.509 --> 01:38:04.845
My supplies were completely exhausted.

01:38:06.506 --> 01:38:10.559
The last time I went to sleep,
I didn't even set a waking date.

01:38:13.971 --> 01:38:16.857
You have literally raised me
from the dead.

01:38:17.600 --> 01:38:19.850
Lazarus.

01:38:20.686 --> 01:38:24.240
- What about the others?
- I'm afraid you're it, sir.

01:38:24.649 --> 01:38:27.368
So far, surely.

01:38:27.819 --> 01:38:32.757
No, our present situation is that there's
very little chance of rescuing any others.

01:38:36.411 --> 01:38:38.921
Dr. Mann. Dr. Mann?

01:38:39.497 --> 01:38:41.390
Tell us about your world.

01:38:44.669 --> 01:38:46.612
Our world, we hope.

01:38:50.341 --> 01:38:52.744
Our world... is cold...

01:38:52.844 --> 01:38:54.637
stark...

01:38:56.013 --> 01:38:58.149
but undeniably beautiful.

01:39:00.101 --> 01:39:03.654
The days are 67 hours long, cold.

01:39:07.558 --> 01:39:09.177
The nights are...

01:39:09.277 --> 01:39:12.112
67 far colder hours.

01:39:17.452 --> 01:39:21.856
The gravity is a very, very pleasant
80 percent of the Earth's.

01:39:21.956 --> 01:39:25.193
Now, up here where I landed,
the water is alkali...

01:39:25.293 --> 01:39:29.113
and the air has too much ammonia to breathe
for more than just a few minutes...

01:39:29.213 --> 01:39:33.868
but down at the surface,
and there is a surface...

01:39:33.968 --> 01:39:35.660
the chlorine dissipates.

01:39:35.761 --> 01:39:39.874
The ammonia gives way to crystalline
hydrocarbons and breathable air.

01:39:39.974 --> 01:39:44.245
To organics. Possibly even to life.

01:39:44.979 --> 01:39:47.198
We might be sharing this world.

01:39:47.440 --> 01:39:49.267
These readings are from the surface?

01:39:49.367 --> 01:39:52.970
Over the years,
I've dropped various probes.

01:39:53.070 --> 01:39:56.557
- How far have you explored?
- I've mounted several major expeditions.

01:39:56.657 --> 01:40:00.778
But with oxygen in limited supply,
KIPP there really did most of the legwork.

01:40:00.878 --> 01:40:03.606
- What went wrong with him, sir?
- Degeneration.

01:40:03.706 --> 01:40:07.360
He misidentified the first organics
we found as ammonia crystals.

01:40:07.460 --> 01:40:11.656
We struggled on for a time,
but ultimately I decommissioned him and...

01:40:11.756 --> 01:40:13.991
used his power source
to keep the mission going.

01:40:14.091 --> 01:40:17.161
I thought I was alone
before I shut him down.

01:40:17.261 --> 01:40:19.230
Would you like me to look at him?

01:40:19.430 --> 01:40:21.666
No. No. He needs a human touch.

01:40:21.766 --> 01:40:26.337
Dr. Brand, CASE is relaying a message
for you from the comm station.

01:40:26.437 --> 01:40:29.198
Okay. Be right there. Excuse me.

01:40:40.910 --> 01:40:43.596
Dr. Brand, I'm sorry to tell you
that your father died today.

01:40:44.205 --> 01:40:46.331
He had no pain.

01:40:48.960 --> 01:40:50.761
He was at peace.

01:40:52.547 --> 01:40:54.682
I'm sorry for your loss.

01:40:56.759 --> 01:40:58.102
Is that Murph?

01:40:58.511 --> 01:41:01.038
She's... She's grown.

01:41:01.138 --> 01:41:03.223
Brand, did you know?

01:41:03.891 --> 01:41:06.060
He told you, right?

01:41:08.604 --> 01:41:10.197
You knew.

01:41:11.649 --> 01:41:13.250
This was all a sham.

01:41:14.193 --> 01:41:16.361
You left us here.

01:41:17.989 --> 01:41:19.790
To suffocate.

01:41:21.576 --> 01:41:23.252
To starve.

01:41:26.289 --> 01:41:28.073
Did my father know too?

01:41:30.459 --> 01:41:32.219
Dad?

01:41:33.671 --> 01:41:35.890
I just want to know...

01:41:36.924 --> 01:41:39.126
if you left me here to die.

01:41:41.512 --> 01:41:43.814
I just have to know.

01:41:49.020 --> 01:41:50.738
Cooper, my...

01:41:51.939 --> 01:41:54.133
My father dedicated...

01:41:54.233 --> 01:41:59.738
his whole life to Plan A.
I have no idea what she's talking about.

01:42:01.048 --> 01:42:02.616
I do.

01:42:07.246 --> 01:42:10.215
He never even hoped
to get the people off the Earth?

01:42:11.125 --> 01:42:12.635
No.

01:42:16.380 --> 01:42:20.517
But he's been trying to solve
the gravity equation for 40 years.

01:42:20.718 --> 01:42:24.438
Amelia, your father solved his equation
before I even left.

01:42:24.722 --> 01:42:26.666
Then why wouldn't he use it?

01:42:26.766 --> 01:42:30.795
The equation couldn't reconcile relativity
with quantum mechanics. You need more.

01:42:30.895 --> 01:42:32.880
More? More what?

01:42:32.980 --> 01:42:36.050
More data.
You need to see into a black hole.

01:42:36.150 --> 01:42:38.302
The laws of nature prohibit
a naked singularity.

01:42:38.402 --> 01:42:40.204
Romilly, is that true?

01:42:41.197 --> 01:42:44.976
If a black hole is an oyster,
then the singularity's the pearl inside.

01:42:45.076 --> 01:42:49.913
The gravity's so strong, it's always
hidden in darkness... behind the horizon.

01:42:50.831 --> 01:42:52.984
That's why we call it a black hole.

01:42:53.084 --> 01:42:56.804
Okay, but if we see
beyond the horizon...

01:42:57.088 --> 01:42:58.656
We can't, Coop.

01:42:58.756 --> 01:43:01.492
There are some things
that aren't meant to be known.

01:43:01.592 --> 01:43:05.705
Your father had to find another way
to save the human race from extinction.

01:43:05.805 --> 01:43:09.441
- Plan B. A colony.
- Why not tell people?

01:43:10.726 --> 01:43:13.879
- Why keep building those stations?
- He knew how hard it would be...

01:43:13.979 --> 01:43:18.175
to get people to work together to save
the species instead of themselves.

01:43:18.475 --> 01:43:20.720
- Or their children.
- Bullshit.

01:43:20.820 --> 01:43:23.681
You never would've come here
unless you believed you would save them.

01:43:23.781 --> 01:43:26.659
Evolution has yet to transcend
that simple barrier.

01:43:26.759 --> 01:43:30.651
We can care deeply,
selflessly about those we know,

01:43:30.751 --> 01:43:33.357
but that empathy rarely extends
beyond our line of sight.

01:43:33.457 --> 01:43:35.467
But the lie.

01:43:38.462 --> 01:43:41.081
That monstrous lie?

01:43:42.133 --> 01:43:45.352
Unforgivable. And he knew that.

01:43:45.803 --> 01:43:50.207
He was prepared to destroy his own humanity
in order to save the species.

01:43:50.307 --> 01:43:53.027
- He made an incredible sacrifice.
- No.

01:43:54.145 --> 01:43:59.124
An incredible sacrifice is being made
by the people on Earth who are gonna die!

01:43:59.483 --> 01:44:01.752
Because in his fucking arrogance...

01:44:02.069 --> 01:44:04.255
he declared their case hopeless.

01:44:04.822 --> 01:44:08.392
I'm sorry, Cooper...
their case is hopeless.

01:44:08.492 --> 01:44:10.919
No. No.

01:44:11.245 --> 01:44:12.847
We are the future.

01:44:16.417 --> 01:44:18.635
Cooper, what can I do?

01:44:21.547 --> 01:44:23.482
Let me go home.

01:44:23.966 --> 01:44:25.985
You're absolutely positive?

01:44:26.510 --> 01:44:29.113
His solution was correct.
He'd had it for years.

01:44:29.680 --> 01:44:32.408
- It's worthless?
- It's half the answer.

01:44:33.267 --> 01:44:36.370
Okay, how do you find the other half?

01:44:36.854 --> 01:44:38.589
Out there? A black hole.

01:44:38.689 --> 01:44:41.825
- But stuck down here on Earth?
- Yeah?

01:44:42.860 --> 01:44:44.828
I'm not sure you can.

01:44:46.447 --> 01:44:49.416
God, they just pack up and leave.

01:44:50.534 --> 01:44:52.920
What are they hoping to find?

01:44:53.204 --> 01:44:54.546
Survival.

01:45:02.046 --> 01:45:03.430
Damn it.

01:45:06.050 --> 01:45:09.945
Murph, don't...?
Don't people have a right to know?

01:45:10.471 --> 01:45:14.625
Panic won't help. We just
have to keep working, same as ever.

01:45:14.725 --> 01:45:18.129
But isn't that exactly what Professor Brand
was manipulating us to do?

01:45:18.229 --> 01:45:21.582
Brand gave up on us.
I'm still trying to solve this.

01:45:22.107 --> 01:45:23.692
So...

01:45:24.610 --> 01:45:26.579
do you have an idea?

01:45:26.987 --> 01:45:28.622
A feeling.

01:45:31.742 --> 01:45:34.044
I told you about my ghost.

01:45:35.746 --> 01:45:38.049
My dad thought I called it a ghost...

01:45:38.149 --> 01:45:40.217
because I was scared of it.

01:45:43.379 --> 01:45:45.712
But I was never scared of it.

01:45:46.924 --> 01:45:49.893
I called it a ghost because it felt...

01:45:52.012 --> 01:45:53.981
It felt like a person.

01:45:56.225 --> 01:45:58.193
It was trying to tell me something.

01:46:00.855 --> 01:46:03.958
If there's an answer here on Earth,
it's back there...

01:46:04.316 --> 01:46:08.829
somehow, in that room.
So I have to find it.

01:46:11.949 --> 01:46:14.001
We're running out of time.

01:46:15.619 --> 01:46:17.688
What about auxiliary oxygen scrubbers?

01:46:17.788 --> 01:46:20.024
No, they can stay.
I'll be sleeping anyway.

01:46:20.124 --> 01:46:21.776
- Hey, Coop?
- Yeah?

01:46:21.876 --> 01:46:23.944
I have a suggestion
for your return journey.

01:46:24.044 --> 01:46:26.897
- Yeah, what's that?
- Have one last crack at the black hole.

01:46:28.674 --> 01:46:30.126
I'm going home, Rom.

01:46:30.226 --> 01:46:33.979
Yeah, I know.
This isn't going to cost you any time.

01:46:34.430 --> 01:46:36.465
There's a chance for the people on Earth.

01:46:37.016 --> 01:46:40.127
- Talk to me.
- Gargantua's an older spinning black hole.

01:46:40.227 --> 01:46:44.173
- It's what we call a gentle singularity.
- Gentle?

01:46:44.273 --> 01:46:47.802
They're hardly gentle.
But the tidal gravity is so quick that...

01:46:47.902 --> 01:46:52.223
something crossing the horizon fast
might survive. A probe, say.

01:46:52.323 --> 01:46:57.061
- What happens after it crosses?
- After the horizon is a complete mystery.

01:46:57.161 --> 01:47:00.314
So, what's to say
there isn't some way that the probe...

01:47:00.414 --> 01:47:03.400
can glimpse the singularity
and relay the quantum data?

01:47:03.500 --> 01:47:06.821
If he's equipped to transmit
every form of energy that can pulse.

01:47:06.921 --> 01:47:10.015
Just when did this probe
become a "he," professor?

01:47:10.257 --> 01:47:12.309
TARS is the obvious candidate.

01:47:12.843 --> 01:47:14.829
I've already told him what to look for.

01:47:14.929 --> 01:47:17.706
I'd need the old optical transmitter
off KIPP, Cooper.

01:47:17.806 --> 01:47:19.208
You'd do this for us?

01:47:19.308 --> 01:47:23.529
Before you get all teary, remember that
as a robot I have to do anything you say.

01:47:24.146 --> 01:47:27.616
- Your cue light's broken.
- I'm not joking.

01:47:29.944 --> 01:47:33.264
I'm gonna need TARS to remove and adapt
some components from KIPP.

01:47:33.364 --> 01:47:35.766
I don't want to disturb
his archival functions.

01:47:35.866 --> 01:47:37.601
I'll supervise.

01:47:37.701 --> 01:47:38.811
All right.

01:47:38.911 --> 01:47:43.649
Dr. Mann, we need to find three secure sites.
One for Brand's lab, two for habitat.

01:47:43.749 --> 01:47:46.277
Once those modules have landed,
you don't want to move them.

01:47:46.377 --> 01:47:48.988
I can take you to the probe sites,
but I don't think...

01:47:49.088 --> 01:47:51.866
these conditions are gonna hold.
I think we should wait.

01:47:51.966 --> 01:47:54.869
CASE is headed down
with the rest of the distillery equipment.

01:47:54.969 --> 01:47:58.105
I'd really like to secure
those sites by nightfall.

01:47:59.723 --> 01:48:03.110
Well, these squalls do usually blow over.

01:48:03.227 --> 01:48:04.420
Okay, then.

01:48:04.520 --> 01:48:06.797
- You'll need a long-range transmitter.
- Got it.

01:48:06.897 --> 01:48:08.740
- Are you charged?
- Yeah.

01:48:09.024 --> 01:48:10.367
Follow me.

01:48:10.859 --> 01:48:14.505
- TARS, 72 hours, yeah?
- Roger that, Cooper.

01:48:20.703 --> 01:48:24.047
Brand told me why you feel
you have to go back.

01:48:25.482 --> 01:48:28.569
But I'd be remiss
if I didn't at least mention...

01:48:28.669 --> 01:48:32.940
that a mission such as ours
could certainly use an extra engineer.

01:48:34.675 --> 01:48:39.029
You better slow down, turbo.
Safety first, CASE, remember.

01:48:39.555 --> 01:48:41.607
Safety first, Cooper.

01:48:42.558 --> 01:48:45.636
I have to tell you, Dr. Mann,
I'm honored to be a part of this.

01:48:45.936 --> 01:48:51.242
But once we set up base camp and secure
those modules, my work's done here.

01:48:51.358 --> 01:48:52.693
I'm going home.

01:49:00.701 --> 01:49:03.861
You have attachments.
But even without a family...

01:49:03.961 --> 01:49:09.384
I can promise you that that yearning
to be with other people is powerful.

01:49:09.752 --> 01:49:13.388
That emotion is at the foundation...

01:49:13.756 --> 01:49:16.900
of what makes us human.
It's not to be taken lightly.

01:49:24.808 --> 01:49:27.494
- How long have you had that cough?
- A while.

01:49:37.946 --> 01:49:40.165
Mom lets me play in here.

01:49:41.584 --> 01:49:43.335
I don't touch your stuff.

01:50:14.024 --> 01:50:15.951
Just take this gently.

01:50:20.781 --> 01:50:24.459
You know why we couldn't just send machines
on these missions, don't you, Cooper?

01:50:24.785 --> 01:50:29.514
A machine doesn't improvise well
because you can't program a fear of death.

01:50:30.290 --> 01:50:34.609
Our survival instinct is our single
greatest source of inspiration.

01:50:34.723 --> 01:50:36.638
Take you, for example.

01:50:37.047 --> 01:50:38.682
A father...

01:50:38.882 --> 01:50:42.185
with a survival instinct
that extends to your kids.

01:50:43.053 --> 01:50:48.024
What does research tell us is the last thing
you're going to see before you die?

01:50:49.434 --> 01:50:52.129
Your children. Their faces.

01:50:52.229 --> 01:50:56.992
At the moment of death, your mind's
gonna push a little bit harder to survive.

01:50:57.401 --> 01:50:58.943
For them.

01:50:59.319 --> 01:51:00.871
Deep breath.

01:51:02.865 --> 01:51:06.810
Hey. I bet you're Coop.
Why don't you have a seat here for me?

01:51:06.910 --> 01:51:09.546
It's bad. They cannot stay here.

01:51:09.955 --> 01:51:11.348
- Okay?
- Yeah.

01:51:19.590 --> 01:51:21.116
TARS, what's taking so long?

01:51:21.216 --> 01:51:24.161
Professor, I am having trouble
completing the boot up.

01:51:24.261 --> 01:51:26.004
I don't understand.

01:51:32.603 --> 01:51:34.154
It's funny.

01:51:35.939 --> 01:51:37.866
When I left Earth...

01:51:38.567 --> 01:51:40.952
I thought I was prepared to die.

01:51:42.696 --> 01:51:44.531
The truth is...

01:51:46.241 --> 01:51:51.546
I never really considered the possibility
that my planet wasn't the one.

01:51:53.957 --> 01:51:56.360
Nothing worked out the way
it was supposed to.

01:51:56.460 --> 01:51:58.002
Let's go.

01:52:05.969 --> 01:52:08.864
All right, buddy,
give me a big deep breath.

01:52:13.560 --> 01:52:15.078
What is this?

01:52:15.395 --> 01:52:19.466
- What are you doing?
- I'm sorry! I can't let you leave with that ship.

01:52:19.566 --> 01:52:22.136
We're gonna need it
to complete the mission...

01:52:22.236 --> 01:52:25.848
once the others realize
what this place isn't.

01:52:25.948 --> 01:52:30.269
We cannot survive here.
I'm sorry! I'm sorry!

01:52:39.962 --> 01:52:43.157
- They can't stay here anymore.
- You have to leave right now.

01:52:43.257 --> 01:52:46.869
Let me make something abundantly clear.
You have a responsibility...

01:52:46.969 --> 01:52:50.230
- Oh! Jesus!
- Coop, get her stuff. She's going home.

01:52:50.430 --> 01:52:52.416
Dad didn't raise you
to be this dumb, Tom!

01:52:52.516 --> 01:52:56.703
Dad didn't raise me, Grandpa did.
And he's buried out back with Mom and Jesse.

01:52:57.187 --> 01:53:00.156
You faked all the data?

01:53:01.566 --> 01:53:02.951
Yeah.

01:53:06.655 --> 01:53:08.432
There's no surface?

01:53:08.532 --> 01:53:10.000
No.

01:53:10.659 --> 01:53:12.728
I tried to do my duty, Cooper...

01:53:12.828 --> 01:53:18.133
but I knew the day that I arrived here
that this place had nothing.

01:53:18.458 --> 01:53:22.554
And I resisted
the temptation for years...

01:53:22.879 --> 01:53:25.199
but I knew that...

01:53:25.299 --> 01:53:28.327
if I just pressed that button, then...

01:53:28.427 --> 01:53:30.529
somebody would come and save me.

01:53:31.471 --> 01:53:33.073
You fucking coward.

01:53:33.807 --> 01:53:34.950
Yes.

01:53:40.272 --> 01:53:41.615
Yes.

01:53:43.233 --> 01:53:44.576
Yes.

01:53:45.527 --> 01:53:46.637
Yes.

01:53:58.081 --> 01:54:02.727
Listen, if you're not going to go,
let your family go. Just save your family.

01:54:03.128 --> 01:54:07.574
And we go live underground with you?
Pray that Daddy comes to save us?

01:54:07.674 --> 01:54:11.648
Dad's not coming back.
He never was coming back. It's up to me.

01:54:11.748 --> 01:54:14.661
You're gonna save everybody?
Because Dad couldn't do it.

01:54:14.761 --> 01:54:19.069
Dad didn't even try!
Dad just abandoned us!

01:54:19.519 --> 01:54:21.613
He left us here to die.

01:54:22.022 --> 01:54:23.790
Nobody's going with you.

01:54:27.402 --> 01:54:30.413
You gonna wait for your next kid to die?

01:54:33.116 --> 01:54:34.709
Get out.

01:54:35.285 --> 01:54:36.920
And don't come back.

01:54:41.500 --> 01:54:43.635
You can keep my stuff.

01:54:54.262 --> 01:54:55.939
Stop it!

01:54:58.642 --> 01:55:00.527
No. No!

01:55:01.311 --> 01:55:04.489
Dr. Mann, there's a 50-50 chance
you're gonna kill yourself!

01:55:05.023 --> 01:55:07.092
Those are the best odds
I've had in years.

01:55:27.462 --> 01:55:29.597
Don't judge me, Cooper.

01:55:30.048 --> 01:55:34.386
You were never tested like I was.
Few men have been.

01:55:42.727 --> 01:55:44.195
You tried your best, Murph.

01:55:53.405 --> 01:55:55.703
You're feeling it, aren't you?

01:55:56.450 --> 01:55:58.585
The survival instinct.

01:55:59.202 --> 01:56:03.640
That's what drove me. It's what drives
all of us. And it's what's gonna save us.

01:56:04.708 --> 01:56:08.344
Because I want to save all of us.
For you, Cooper.

01:56:13.216 --> 01:56:16.995
I'm sorry, I can't watch you
go through this. I'm sorry.

01:56:17.095 --> 01:56:20.064
I thought I could, but I can't.

01:56:20.849 --> 01:56:23.210
I'm here. I'm here for you.

01:56:23.310 --> 01:56:25.653
Just listen to my voice, Cooper.

01:56:26.146 --> 01:56:27.981
I'm right here.

01:56:29.316 --> 01:56:30.950
You're not alone.

01:56:40.368 --> 01:56:42.070
Do you see your children?

01:56:45.123 --> 01:56:46.758
It's okay.

01:56:47.417 --> 01:56:49.469
They're right there with you.

01:56:53.048 --> 01:56:55.934
Did Professor Brand tell you
that poem before you left?

01:56:56.468 --> 01:56:58.269
Do you remember?

01:57:00.347 --> 01:57:03.616
Do not go gentle into that good night

01:57:04.935 --> 01:57:09.781
Old age should burn and rave
At close of day

01:57:11.066 --> 01:57:13.743
Rage, rage against
the dying of the light

01:57:38.093 --> 01:57:39.828
Brand! Help!

01:57:39.928 --> 01:57:42.188
- Help!
- Cooper?

01:57:48.603 --> 01:57:50.088
CASE!

01:57:50.188 --> 01:57:51.781
No air.

01:57:52.315 --> 01:57:53.825
Ammonia.

01:57:54.609 --> 01:57:57.179
Cooper. Cooper, we're coming! CASE!

01:57:57.279 --> 01:57:59.264
- I have a fix.
- Go! Go, go, go!

01:57:59.364 --> 01:58:01.749
And away!

01:58:13.003 --> 01:58:15.280
Cooper, we're coming.
Hang in there. Don't talk.

01:58:15.380 --> 01:58:17.974
Try to breathe as little as possible.
We're almost there.

01:58:21.444 --> 01:58:27.066
There's a security lockout, sir.
It requires a person to access function.

01:58:31.813 --> 01:58:33.615
It's all yours, sir.

01:58:41.631 --> 01:58:43.391
Try not to breathe.

01:58:43.992 --> 01:58:48.021
We're coming. We're coming right now.
CASE, come on! Come on!

01:58:48.121 --> 01:58:51.132
We got to go faster, CASE!
Faster, faster, faster!

01:58:55.337 --> 01:58:57.347
Hang in there. Come on.

01:59:03.553 --> 01:59:07.148
I see him, I see him!
CASE, bank! Bank right!

01:59:25.867 --> 01:59:28.970
Cooper! Cooper! I'm here!

01:59:52.102 --> 01:59:54.304
This data makes no sense.

02:00:02.529 --> 02:00:04.014
I'm sorry.

02:00:04.114 --> 02:00:07.000
- What?
- Mann was lying!

02:00:14.457 --> 02:00:16.551
Go. Go.

02:00:17.335 --> 02:00:18.653
Romilly.

02:00:18.753 --> 02:00:20.030
Romilly!

02:00:20.130 --> 02:00:22.849
Romilly! Do you read me, Romilly?

02:00:23.133 --> 02:00:25.235
Step back, professor! Step back!

02:00:33.059 --> 02:00:35.945
- Romilly...
- Romilly, do you read me?

02:00:38.648 --> 02:00:40.483
Keep watch!

02:00:41.151 --> 02:00:42.377
Lois?

02:00:42.777 --> 02:00:45.580
- What happened to caution, CASE?
- Safety first, Cooper.

02:00:46.656 --> 02:00:50.376
Romilly? Romilly, do you read me?
This is Brand.

02:00:52.954 --> 02:00:54.064
Romilly?

02:00:54.164 --> 02:00:57.050
Dr. Brand. Cooper.
There's been an explosion.

02:00:57.375 --> 02:00:59.469
Dr. Mann's compound.

02:01:26.780 --> 02:01:29.123
TARS, TARS, 10 o'clock!

02:01:35.205 --> 02:01:37.465
Let me know when TARS is aboard.

02:01:40.794 --> 02:01:42.970
Romilly did not survive.

02:01:43.880 --> 02:01:45.615
I could not save him.

02:01:45.715 --> 02:01:47.242
- TARS is in.
- I'll take her now.

02:01:47.342 --> 02:01:50.286
- Do we have a fix on the Ranger?
- He's pushing into orbit!

02:01:50.386 --> 02:01:53.689
If he takes control
of that ship, we're dead.

02:01:54.599 --> 02:01:57.860
- He'd maroon us?
- He is marooning us.

02:01:59.562 --> 02:02:02.365
I'll meet you guys downstairs.
Go wait by the car.

02:02:09.906 --> 02:02:14.418
Come on! Give me your bag.
Get in the backseat. Get in the backseat now!

02:02:19.749 --> 02:02:21.968
Dr. Mann, please respond.

02:02:22.293 --> 02:02:24.446
Dr. Mann, please respond!

02:02:24.746 --> 02:02:26.823
He doesn't know
the Endurance docking procedure.

02:02:26.923 --> 02:02:29.725
- The autopilot does.
- Not since TARS disabled it.

02:02:30.635 --> 02:02:31.745
Nice.

02:02:31.845 --> 02:02:35.064
- What's your trust setting, TARS?
- Lower than yours apparently.

02:02:38.393 --> 02:02:42.005
Do not attempt docking.
I repeat, do not attempt docking.

02:02:42.105 --> 02:02:43.214
Please res...

02:03:42.582 --> 02:03:45.026
Auto-docking sequence withheld.

02:03:45.126 --> 02:03:48.095
- Override.
- Unauthorized.

02:03:48.504 --> 02:03:50.139
Override.

02:03:50.340 --> 02:03:52.516
Unauthorized.

02:03:56.346 --> 02:04:00.575
Do not attempt docking. I repeat,
do not attempt docking. Please resp...

02:04:44.268 --> 02:04:46.537
Moving slowly toward the Endurance.

02:05:10.962 --> 02:05:12.614
Imperfect contact.

02:05:12.714 --> 02:05:15.057
- Override.
- Hatch lockout.

02:05:22.557 --> 02:05:25.401
- Is he locked on yet?
- Imperfectly.

02:05:26.936 --> 02:05:28.254
Dr. Mann, do not...

02:05:49.667 --> 02:05:52.970
Hatch lockout disengaged.

02:06:01.220 --> 02:06:04.958
Dr. Mann, do not,
I repeat, do not open the hatch.

02:06:05.058 --> 02:06:07.001
I repeat, do not open the hatch.

02:06:07.101 --> 02:06:10.237
If you open the hatch,
the airlock will depressurize.

02:06:35.838 --> 02:06:38.432
- What happens if he blows the airlock?
- Nothing good.

02:06:44.013 --> 02:06:46.708
Okay, pull back. Retro thrusters,
everything we've got, CASE!

02:06:46.808 --> 02:06:48.584
- Thrusters are full!
- Back!

02:06:48.684 --> 02:06:50.753
Relay my transmission
to the onboard computer...

02:06:50.853 --> 02:06:53.006
and have it rebroadcast
as emergency P.A.

02:06:53.106 --> 02:06:54.448
Dr. Mann...

02:06:56.734 --> 02:06:59.679
I repeat, do not open
the inner hatch. I repeat...

02:06:59.779 --> 02:07:01.122
Brand?

02:07:01.656 --> 02:07:03.766
I don't know what he said to you...

02:07:03.866 --> 02:07:06.836
but I am taking command
of the Endurance.

02:07:06.994 --> 02:07:09.338
And then we can talk
about completing the mission.

02:07:12.500 --> 02:07:14.310
Dr. Mann, listen to me.

02:07:15.002 --> 02:07:17.304
This is not about my life.

02:07:17.630 --> 02:07:21.183
Or Cooper's life.
This is about all mankind.

02:07:21.467 --> 02:07:23.085
There is a moment...

02:07:29.225 --> 02:07:30.660
It is not sa...

02:07:38.860 --> 02:07:40.002
Oh, my God.

02:07:58.212 --> 02:08:02.475
- There's no point using fuel to chase...
- Analyze the Endurance's spin.

02:08:07.430 --> 02:08:09.940
- Cooper, what are you doing?
- Docking.

02:08:14.228 --> 02:08:17.131
Endurance rotation is 67, 68 RPM.

02:08:17.231 --> 02:08:19.759
Okay, get ready to match our spin
with the retro thrusters.

02:08:19.859 --> 02:08:23.379
- It's not possible.
- No... it's necessary.

02:08:34.916 --> 02:08:37.384
Endurance is hitting stratosphere!

02:08:41.130 --> 02:08:43.474
She's got no heat shield.

02:08:46.302 --> 02:08:48.154
- CASE, you ready?
- Ready.

02:08:56.479 --> 02:08:59.949
Cooper! This is no time for caution.

02:09:01.192 --> 02:09:03.719
CASE, if I black out,
you take the stick.

02:09:03.819 --> 02:09:06.580
TARS, get ready to engage
the docking mechanism.

02:09:13.329 --> 02:09:16.399
- Endurance is starting to heat.
- Twenty feet out.

02:09:16.499 --> 02:09:19.068
I need three degrees starboard, Cooper.

02:09:19.168 --> 02:09:21.237
Ten feet out.

02:09:21.337 --> 02:09:23.906
Cooper, we are lined up.

02:09:24.006 --> 02:09:25.691
Initiating spin!

02:10:07.174 --> 02:10:08.484
Come on, TARS.

02:10:16.642 --> 02:10:18.285
Come on, TARS!

02:10:29.405 --> 02:10:32.124
- We are locked, Cooper.
- Locked. Easing up!

02:10:39.707 --> 02:10:41.342
Easy.

02:10:42.209 --> 02:10:43.844
Easy.

02:10:49.383 --> 02:10:50.785
Retro thrusters!

02:10:58.851 --> 02:11:00.653
Main engines on.

02:11:06.108 --> 02:11:09.019
Pushing out of orbit. Come on, baby.

02:11:16.827 --> 02:11:18.796
Killing main engines!

02:11:19.747 --> 02:11:21.715
Okay, we're out of orbit.

02:11:28.756 --> 02:11:31.834
Okay. And for our next trick!

02:11:33.469 --> 02:11:37.606
It'll have to be good.
We're heading into Gargantua's pull.

02:11:38.224 --> 02:11:39.366
Oh, shit.

02:11:39.767 --> 02:11:41.660
- CASE, take the stick.
- Roger that.

02:12:31.527 --> 02:12:33.963
Cooper, we're slipping towards Gargantua.

02:12:35.197 --> 02:12:37.224
Shall I use main engines?

02:12:37.324 --> 02:12:41.503
No. We got to let her slide
as far as we can.

02:12:50.004 --> 02:12:52.948
- Give it to me.
- There's good news, there's bad news.

02:12:53.048 --> 02:12:56.777
Yeah, I've heard that one, TARS.
Give it to me straight.

02:13:05.519 --> 02:13:08.798
The backup generator kicked in,
so the system's stable. They're all good.

02:13:08.898 --> 02:13:10.240
Good.

02:13:10.357 --> 02:13:13.761
Okay. The navigational hub
has been completely destroyed.

02:13:13.861 --> 02:13:16.889
We don't have enough life support
to make it back to Earth, but...

02:13:16.989 --> 02:13:19.141
I think we can scratch our way
to Edmunds' planet.

02:13:19.241 --> 02:13:23.596
- What about fuel?
- Not enough. But I have a plan.

02:13:24.121 --> 02:13:28.525
We let Gargantua pull us down
close to her horizon.

02:13:28.626 --> 02:13:31.946
Then a powered slingshot around,
launching us towards Edmunds' planet.

02:13:32.046 --> 02:13:34.615
- Manually?
- That's what I'm here for.

02:13:34.715 --> 02:13:37.293
I'm gonna take us
just inside the critical orbit.

02:13:37.393 --> 02:13:40.162
- What about time slippage?
- Neither of us has time to worry...

02:13:40.262 --> 02:13:42.232
about relativity right now, Dr. Brand.

02:13:46.560 --> 02:13:48.162
I'm sorry, Cooper.

02:13:51.190 --> 02:13:54.677
Once we've gathered
enough speed around Gargantua...

02:13:54.777 --> 02:13:56.912
we use Lander 1...

02:13:57.112 --> 02:13:59.706
and Ranger 2 as rocket boosters to...

02:14:00.274 --> 02:14:03.076
push us out of the black hole's gravity.

02:14:04.912 --> 02:14:07.648
The Lender's linkages
have been destroyed...

02:14:07.748 --> 02:14:10.384
so we'll have to control manually.

02:14:11.293 --> 02:14:14.622
Once Lander 1 is spent,
TARS will detach...

02:14:14.722 --> 02:14:16.832
And get sucked into that black hole.

02:14:17.258 --> 02:14:18.885
Why does TARS have to detach?

02:14:18.985 --> 02:14:21.495
We have to shed the weight
to escape the gravity.

02:14:21.595 --> 02:14:23.038
Newton's third law.

02:14:23.138 --> 02:14:25.916
The only way humans have ever
figured out of getting somewhere...

02:14:26.016 --> 02:14:27.626
is to leave something behind.

02:14:27.726 --> 02:14:30.837
Cooper, you can't ask TARS
to do this for us.

02:14:30.938 --> 02:14:34.842
He's a robot. So you don't have
to ask him to do anything.

02:14:34.942 --> 02:14:38.662
- Cooper, you asshole!
- Sorry, you broke up a little bit there.

02:14:38.862 --> 02:14:41.348
It's what we intended, Dr. Brand.

02:14:41.448 --> 02:14:43.976
It's our only chance
to save people on Earth.

02:14:44.076 --> 02:14:47.354
If I can find a way to transmit
the quantum data I'll find in there...

02:14:47.454 --> 02:14:49.590
they might still make it.

02:14:50.533 --> 02:14:53.460
Let's just hope
there's still someone there to save.

02:15:21.447 --> 02:15:23.415
Maximum velocity achieved.

02:15:24.366 --> 02:15:26.936
Prepare to fire escape thrusters.

02:15:27.336 --> 02:15:29.772
- Ready?
- Ready.

02:15:29.872 --> 02:15:33.067
- Ready.
- Main engine ignition in three...

02:15:33.167 --> 02:15:34.635
two...

02:15:34.960 --> 02:15:36.895
one. Mark.

02:15:50.225 --> 02:15:51.777
Come on, baby.

02:15:52.645 --> 02:15:55.047
Lander 1 engines, on my mark.

02:15:55.601 --> 02:15:57.800
Three, two...

02:15:57.900 --> 02:15:59.701
one. Mark.

02:16:04.740 --> 02:16:07.393
Ranger 2 engines, on my mark.

02:16:07.493 --> 02:16:10.170
Three, two, one...

02:16:10.412 --> 02:16:11.880
- Mark.
- Fire!

02:16:21.715 --> 02:16:25.185
This little maneuver's
gonna cost us 51 years!

02:16:25.761 --> 02:16:28.563
You don't sound so bad for pushing 120!

02:16:43.654 --> 02:16:47.124
Lander 1, prepare to detach on my mark.

02:16:47.491 --> 02:16:50.193
Three, two...

02:16:51.020 --> 02:16:54.056
- one. Mark.
- Detach!

02:16:57.126 --> 02:16:59.695
- Goodbye, TARS.
- Goodbye, Dr. Brand.

02:16:59.795 --> 02:17:02.898
- See you on the other side, Coop.
- See you there, Slick!

02:17:11.306 --> 02:17:13.191
Okay, CASE.

02:17:13.634 --> 02:17:17.612
- Nice reckless flying!
- Learned from the master.

02:17:17.771 --> 02:17:20.424
- Ranger 2, prepare to detach.
- What?

02:17:20.524 --> 02:17:23.744
No! No! Cooper! What are you doing?

02:17:23.902 --> 02:17:27.681
Newton's third law.
You got to leave something behind.

02:17:27.781 --> 02:17:30.267
You told me we had enough resources
for both of us.

02:17:30.367 --> 02:17:32.394
We agreed, Amelia...

02:17:32.494 --> 02:17:34.254
90 percent.

02:17:35.831 --> 02:17:37.215
Don't.

02:17:39.126 --> 02:17:40.594
Detach.

02:17:53.390 --> 02:17:56.543
Okay, I am nosing down.

02:17:59.938 --> 02:18:02.240
Approaching the event horizon.

02:18:04.193 --> 02:18:08.997
Portside, dipping down beneath it
to go through it.

02:18:10.282 --> 02:18:13.352
Heading towards blackness.

02:18:13.452 --> 02:18:15.754
I have a visual of the event.

02:18:15.954 --> 02:18:17.631
It's all black.

02:18:19.658 --> 02:18:23.261
TARS, do you read me? It's all blackness.

02:18:24.963 --> 02:18:27.765
TARS! Do you read me? Over.

02:18:31.804 --> 02:18:33.271
Okay.

02:18:34.181 --> 02:18:35.732
Screens...

02:18:37.059 --> 02:18:38.860
getting interference.

02:18:40.270 --> 02:18:43.156
Losing control of the stick.
I got flashes.

02:18:43.440 --> 02:18:45.909
Flashes of lightness and blackness.

02:18:46.819 --> 02:18:49.621
The turbulence in the gravity
is increasing.

02:18:55.994 --> 02:18:58.204
The computers are going down. Agh.

02:19:09.925 --> 02:19:13.061
Gravitational pull.
I'm losing control of the stick.

02:19:46.128 --> 02:19:47.896
Murph? Murph, come on!

02:19:53.468 --> 02:19:55.770
Eject. Eject.

02:19:56.972 --> 02:19:58.356
Eject.

02:19:58.473 --> 02:19:59.941
Eject.

02:20:00.183 --> 02:20:01.526
Eject.

02:20:01.935 --> 02:20:03.320
Eject.

02:21:55.215 --> 02:21:56.558
Murph.

02:22:06.226 --> 02:22:08.495
Murph! Murph! Murph!

02:22:16.778 --> 02:22:18.121
Murph.

02:22:25.037 --> 02:22:27.022
No, no, no!

02:22:27.122 --> 02:22:28.482
Murph!

02:22:28.582 --> 02:22:31.393
Murph! No! No!

02:23:30.977 --> 02:23:33.038
If you're leaving, just go.

02:23:33.438 --> 02:23:34.706
No, no. No.

02:23:36.191 --> 02:23:38.593
No, don't go. Don't go, you idiot.

02:23:38.693 --> 02:23:40.286
Don't go!

02:23:41.947 --> 02:23:43.915
Morse. Morse.

02:23:44.366 --> 02:23:45.708
Morse.

02:23:46.418 --> 02:23:48.478
Dot. Dot.

02:23:48.578 --> 02:23:49.921
S.

02:23:55.752 --> 02:23:57.095
T.

02:24:01.383 --> 02:24:02.534
A.

02:24:02.634 --> 02:24:03.918
Dash!

02:24:06.513 --> 02:24:08.148
Dash! Dash!

02:24:08.348 --> 02:24:09.458
Murph!

02:24:09.558 --> 02:24:11.860
Murph, we don't have time for this!
Come on!

02:24:11.977 --> 02:24:13.603
Y.

02:24:18.600 --> 02:24:19.742
"Stay!"

02:24:30.537 --> 02:24:33.173
Come on. Come on, Murph. Come on!

02:24:33.540 --> 02:24:35.633
What's it say? What's it say, Murph?

02:24:36.126 --> 02:24:37.710
What's it say?

02:24:47.762 --> 02:24:49.189
"Stay."

02:25:24.633 --> 02:25:27.769
Tell him, Murph. Make him stay.

02:25:31.188 --> 02:25:32.774
Make him stay, Murph.

02:25:41.483 --> 02:25:43.660
Make him stay, Murph.

02:25:44.819 --> 02:25:47.247
Don't let me leave, Murph!

02:25:50.158 --> 02:25:52.877
Don't let me leave, Murph!

02:25:58.475 --> 02:26:01.310
No! No! No!

02:26:21.698 --> 02:26:23.499
It was you.

02:26:34.369 --> 02:26:36.713
You were my ghost.

02:26:46.131 --> 02:26:49.734
Cooper. Cooper. Come in, Cooper.

02:26:50.927 --> 02:26:53.730
- TARS?
- Roger that.

02:26:55.223 --> 02:26:58.151
- You survived.
- Somewhere...

02:26:58.393 --> 02:27:00.503
in their fifth dimension.

02:27:00.603 --> 02:27:03.006
They saved us.

02:27:03.106 --> 02:27:08.386
Yeah? Who the hell is "they"?
And just why would they want to help us?

02:27:08.486 --> 02:27:11.264
I don't know, but they constructed
this three-dimensional space...

02:27:11.364 --> 02:27:14.726
inside their five-dimensional reality
to allow you to understand it.

02:27:14.826 --> 02:27:16.853
Yeah, that ain't working.

02:27:16.953 --> 02:27:18.563
Yes, it is.

02:27:18.663 --> 02:27:22.609
You've seen that time is represented here
as a physical dimension.

02:27:22.709 --> 02:27:25.845
You have worked out that you can exert
a force across space-time.

02:27:26.212 --> 02:27:29.658
Gravity to send a message.

02:27:29.958 --> 02:27:31.592
Affirmative.

02:27:33.678 --> 02:27:35.304
Gravity...

02:27:35.930 --> 02:27:39.501
can cross the dimensions, including time.

02:27:39.601 --> 02:27:41.194
Apparently.

02:27:44.773 --> 02:27:47.075
Do you have the quantum data?

02:27:47.192 --> 02:27:49.118
Roger. I have it.

02:27:49.778 --> 02:27:53.848
I am transmitting it on all wavelengths,
but nothing is getting out, Cooper.

02:27:53.948 --> 02:27:56.501
I can do this. I can do this.

02:27:56.659 --> 02:27:59.479
But such complicated data to a child?

02:27:59.579 --> 02:28:00.772
Not just any child.

02:28:00.872 --> 02:28:05.259
What else? Oh, come on, Dad.

02:28:07.128 --> 02:28:09.364
Murph, the fire's out! Come on!

02:28:09.464 --> 02:28:13.768
Even if you communicate it here,
she won't understand its significance for years.

02:28:14.260 --> 02:28:15.787
I get that, TARS.

02:28:15.887 --> 02:28:20.625
But we've got to figure something out
or the people on Earth are gonna die. Think!

02:28:20.725 --> 02:28:22.377
Cooper...

02:28:22.477 --> 02:28:25.279
they didn't bring us here
to change the past.

02:28:28.566 --> 02:28:30.135
Say that again.

02:28:30.235 --> 02:28:33.996
They didn't bring us here
to change the past.

02:28:38.118 --> 02:28:40.378
No, they didn't bring us here at all.

02:28:44.707 --> 02:28:46.876
We brought ourselves.

02:28:55.635 --> 02:28:59.981
TARS, give me the coordinates
for NASA in binary.

02:29:00.223 --> 02:29:02.984
In binary. Roger. Feeding data.

02:29:27.000 --> 02:29:29.418
"It's not a ghost."

02:29:30.670 --> 02:29:32.405
"It's gravity."

02:29:32.505 --> 02:29:34.474
Don't you get it yet, TARS?

02:29:34.841 --> 02:29:36.934
I brought myself here!

02:29:37.510 --> 02:29:41.314
We're here to communicate
with the three-dimensional world.

02:29:41.431 --> 02:29:43.232
We're the bridge!

02:29:50.940 --> 02:29:53.034
I thought they chose me.

02:29:56.070 --> 02:30:00.041
- But they didn't choose me, they chose her.
- For what, Cooper?

02:30:02.243 --> 02:30:04.212
To save the world.

02:30:08.208 --> 02:30:12.821
All of this is one little girl's bedroom.
Every moment.

02:30:12.921 --> 02:30:14.406
It's infinitely complex.

02:30:14.506 --> 02:30:19.327
They have access to infinite time and space,
but they're not bound by anything!

02:30:19.427 --> 02:30:24.398
They can't find a specific place in time.
They can't communicate.

02:30:25.600 --> 02:30:28.670
That's why I'm here.
I'm gonna find a way to tell Murph...

02:30:28.770 --> 02:30:30.338
just like I found this moment.

02:30:30.438 --> 02:30:32.841
- How, Cooper?
- Love, TARS, love.

02:30:32.941 --> 02:30:37.429
It's just like Brand said. My connection
with Murph, it is quantifiable. It's the key!

02:30:37.529 --> 02:30:39.705
What are we here to do?

02:30:40.323 --> 02:30:42.500
Find how to tell her.

02:30:44.994 --> 02:30:46.629
The watch.

02:30:49.457 --> 02:30:50.925
The watch.

02:30:52.001 --> 02:30:53.427
That's it.

02:30:55.630 --> 02:30:58.933
We code the data into the movement
of the second hand.

02:31:02.262 --> 02:31:05.540
TARS, translate the data into Morse
and feed it to me.

02:31:05.640 --> 02:31:10.236
Translating data to Morse.
Cooper, what if she never came back for it?

02:31:11.604 --> 02:31:14.574
She will. She will.

02:31:15.483 --> 02:31:17.410
Murph, I can see his car!

02:31:18.319 --> 02:31:19.587
He's coming, Murph!

02:31:21.322 --> 02:31:23.457
Okay. I'm coming down.

02:31:24.617 --> 02:31:26.419
How do you know?

02:31:29.330 --> 02:31:31.465
Because I gave it to her.

02:31:36.546 --> 02:31:39.348
Roger. Morse is dot-dot-dash-dot.

02:31:42.552 --> 02:31:43.979
Dot-dot...

02:31:45.013 --> 02:31:46.981
dash-dot.

02:31:47.140 --> 02:31:49.083
Dot-dash-dot-dot.

02:31:49.183 --> 02:31:52.153
Dot-dash-dot-dot.

02:31:52.353 --> 02:31:53.922
Dash-dash-dash.

02:31:54.022 --> 02:31:56.574
Dash, dash, dash.

02:32:14.542 --> 02:32:16.377
He came back!

02:32:16.794 --> 02:32:21.265
It was him all the time!
I didn't know. It was him!

02:32:22.050 --> 02:32:24.310
Dad's gonna save us.

02:33:06.761 --> 02:33:08.112
Eureka!

02:33:11.766 --> 02:33:13.401
It's traditional.

02:33:17.689 --> 02:33:19.615
Eureka!

02:33:24.028 --> 02:33:25.597
Did it work?

02:33:25.697 --> 02:33:27.832
I think it might have.

02:33:28.908 --> 02:33:30.268
How do you know?

02:33:30.368 --> 02:33:34.046
Because the bulk beings
are closing the tesseract.

02:33:37.583 --> 02:33:39.885
Don't you get it yet, TARS?

02:33:40.753 --> 02:33:42.888
They're not "beings."

02:33:43.256 --> 02:33:44.890
They're us.

02:33:46.634 --> 02:33:50.062
What I've been doing for Murph,
they're doing for me.

02:33:50.304 --> 02:33:51.873
For all of us.

02:33:51.973 --> 02:33:54.292
Cooper, people couldn't build this.

02:33:54.392 --> 02:33:57.045
No. No, not yet.

02:33:57.145 --> 02:33:58.904
But one day.

02:33:59.272 --> 02:34:02.783
Not you and me. But people.

02:34:03.151 --> 02:34:07.496
A civilization that's evolved past
the four dimensions we know.

02:34:13.786 --> 02:34:15.588
What happens now?

02:35:17.892 --> 02:35:19.652
Mr. Cooper.

02:35:23.564 --> 02:35:25.574
All right. Let's take it slow, sir.

02:35:25.691 --> 02:35:27.885
Nice and easy, Mr. Cooper.

02:35:27.985 --> 02:35:33.332
Remember, you're no spring chicken anymore.
Actually, you are 124 years old.

02:35:40.039 --> 02:35:41.674
Take it slow, sir.

02:35:42.291 --> 02:35:44.819
You were... extremely lucky.

02:35:44.919 --> 02:35:48.556
The Rangers found you with only minutes
left in your oxygen supply.

02:36:02.436 --> 02:36:04.071
Where am I?

02:36:05.439 --> 02:36:07.283
Cooper Station.

02:36:08.401 --> 02:36:10.244
Currently orbiting Saturn.

02:36:11.946 --> 02:36:14.290
Cooper Station.

02:36:16.450 --> 02:36:18.519
Nice of you to name it after me.

02:36:22.290 --> 02:36:23.441
What?

02:36:23.541 --> 02:36:26.952
The station isn't named after you, sir.
It's... named after your daughter.

02:36:27.253 --> 02:36:30.323
Although she's always maintained
just how important you were.

02:36:30.423 --> 02:36:32.433
Is she still alive?

02:36:34.093 --> 02:36:36.271
She'll be here in a couple weeks.

02:36:37.013 --> 02:36:39.540
She is far too old to be transferring
from another station...

02:36:39.640 --> 02:36:42.318
but when she heard
that you'd been found...

02:36:43.227 --> 02:36:46.038
well, this is... Murphy Cooper
we're talking about.

02:36:46.814 --> 02:36:48.616
Yes, it is.

02:36:50.443 --> 02:36:53.245
We'll have you checked out of here
in a couple days.

02:36:55.615 --> 02:36:58.417
I'm sure you'll be excited to see
what's in store.

02:36:59.368 --> 02:37:03.564
I actually... did a paper on you
in high school.

02:37:03.664 --> 02:37:06.300
I know all about your life
back on Earth.

02:37:07.668 --> 02:37:08.903
Oh, yeah.

02:37:09.003 --> 02:37:10.554
Right.

02:37:12.673 --> 02:37:18.312
If... If you'll follow me,
we've got a really good situation for you.

02:37:21.349 --> 02:37:25.694
So... when I made my suggestion
to Miss Cooper...

02:37:26.312 --> 02:37:29.606
I was delighted to hear
that she thought it was perfect.

02:37:32.485 --> 02:37:35.847
It was just constant.
Just that steady blow of dirt.

02:37:35.947 --> 02:37:38.933
Of course,
I didn't speak to her personally.

02:37:39.033 --> 02:37:41.102
We always set the plate upside-down.

02:37:41.202 --> 02:37:44.021
Glasses or cups,
whatever it was, upside-down.

02:37:44.121 --> 02:37:49.110
Well, my dad was a farmer.
Like everybody else back then.

02:37:49.210 --> 02:37:51.737
There just wasn't enough food.

02:37:51.837 --> 02:37:54.615
We wore little things, little strips...

02:37:54.715 --> 02:37:59.954
of sheet over our nose and mouth
so we wouldn't breathe so much of it.

02:38:00.054 --> 02:38:03.583
Well, it was pretty exciting for me
because it was hope.

02:38:03.683 --> 02:38:07.962
I don't care who describes it, there is
no way for it to be exaggerated.

02:38:08.062 --> 02:38:11.966
She did confirm
just how much you loved farming.

02:38:12.066 --> 02:38:15.411
- Oh, she did, did she?
- Yeah. Come here.

02:38:15.695 --> 02:38:20.725
Home sweet home.
Everything replaced and put back where it...

02:38:27.039 --> 02:38:29.150
- Hey, is this...?
- Oh, yeah.

02:38:29.250 --> 02:38:32.320
The machine we found out near Saturn
when we found you. Yes.

02:38:32.420 --> 02:38:35.156
Its... power source was shot,
but we could get you another one.

02:38:35.256 --> 02:38:37.725
Yes. Please.

02:38:38.634 --> 02:38:40.269
Settings.

02:38:40.428 --> 02:38:42.229
General settings.

02:38:42.430 --> 02:38:44.565
Security settings.

02:38:46.976 --> 02:38:49.570
Honesty, new setting:

02:38:50.438 --> 02:38:52.298
95 percent.

02:38:52.398 --> 02:38:55.200
Confirmed. Additional customization?

02:38:55.776 --> 02:38:57.202
Humor:

02:38:58.404 --> 02:39:00.181
75 percent.

02:39:00.281 --> 02:39:01.915
Confirmed.

02:39:02.283 --> 02:39:05.478
Auto self-destruct T-minus 10, nine...

02:39:05.578 --> 02:39:07.796
Let's make that 60 percent.

02:39:09.790 --> 02:39:12.218
Sixty percent confirmed.

02:39:12.543 --> 02:39:15.929
- Knock-knock.
- You want 55?

02:39:20.509 --> 02:39:22.936
Is this really what it was like?

02:39:24.847 --> 02:39:27.566
It was never this clean, Slick. Heh.

02:39:31.771 --> 02:39:35.741
I don't care much for this pretending
we're back where we started.

02:39:37.526 --> 02:39:40.120
I want to know where we are.

02:39:41.447 --> 02:39:43.290
Where we're going.

02:39:47.536 --> 02:39:50.690
- Mr. Cooper. The family's all in there.
- Yeah.

02:39:50.790 --> 02:39:51.941
Family?

02:39:52.041 --> 02:39:56.120
Yeah, they all came out to see her. She's
been in cryo-sleep for almost two years.

02:40:28.994 --> 02:40:31.577
You told them I like farming.

02:40:36.836 --> 02:40:39.004
It was me, Murph.

02:40:40.965 --> 02:40:43.058
I was your ghost.

02:40:44.051 --> 02:40:45.978
I know.

02:40:47.471 --> 02:40:52.251
People didn't believe me.
They thought that I was doing it all myself.

02:40:52.351 --> 02:40:53.694
But...

02:40:56.272 --> 02:40:58.732
I knew who it was.

02:41:03.195 --> 02:41:05.664
Nobody believed me.

02:41:05.865 --> 02:41:08.484
But I knew you'd come back.

02:41:10.870 --> 02:41:12.379
How?

02:41:14.081 --> 02:41:17.509
Because my dad promised me.

02:41:23.257 --> 02:41:25.559
Well, I'm here now, Murph.

02:41:26.452 --> 02:41:28.387
I'm here.

02:41:29.346 --> 02:41:30.881
No.

02:41:32.766 --> 02:41:37.196
No parent should have to watch
their own child die.

02:41:39.815 --> 02:41:42.984
I have my kids here for me now.

02:41:44.979 --> 02:41:47.080
You go.

02:41:49.700 --> 02:41:51.502
Where?

02:41:54.705 --> 02:41:56.590
Brand.

02:42:05.933 --> 02:42:08.260
She's out there...

02:42:13.783 --> 02:42:16.235
setting up camp.

02:42:42.419 --> 02:42:44.429
Alone...

02:42:45.297 --> 02:42:48.267
in a strange galaxy.

02:42:58.852 --> 02:43:03.824
Maybe right now
she's settling in for the long nap...

02:43:21.875 --> 02:43:25.012
by the light of our new sun...

02:43:40.185 --> 02:43:42.529
in our new home.
