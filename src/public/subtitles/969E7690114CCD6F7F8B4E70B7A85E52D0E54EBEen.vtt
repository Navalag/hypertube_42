00:00:38.862 --> 00:00:41.321
<i>It's been six months
since Doomsday,</i>

00:00:41.323 --> 00:00:42.922
<i>and the world is still shaken</i>

00:00:42.924 --> 00:00:45.327
<i>by the death of
Kal-El of Krypton.</i>

00:00:48.796 --> 00:00:51.864
Better known to us
as Superman.

00:00:51.866 --> 00:00:55.568
My guest is commentator,
G. Gordon Godfrey.

00:00:55.570 --> 00:00:57.171
Sir, you've
written an editorial

00:00:57.173 --> 00:01:00.007
in which you call on us
to reject so-called "Supers,"

00:01:00.009 --> 00:01:03.244
and effectively
become our own heroes.

00:01:03.246 --> 00:01:05.344
We have an infestation, Cat.

00:01:05.346 --> 00:01:06.979
It's out of control.

00:01:06.981 --> 00:01:09.350
<i>You're writing about
the mysterious new Superman.</i>

00:01:15.257 --> 00:01:16.856
Oh, Eric!

00:01:29.438 --> 00:01:31.505
<i>Look, Cat,
the reality is,</i>

00:01:31.507 --> 00:01:35.041
<i>these are "Supermen"
we know nothing about.</i>

00:01:35.043 --> 00:01:37.110
But they're actually
making a difference.

00:01:37.112 --> 00:01:40.448
Did they make a difference to
the Excalibur Shuttle crew?

00:01:40.450 --> 00:01:42.481
<i>We already have,
difference-makers.</i>

00:01:42.483 --> 00:01:45.821
- <i>The police...</i>
- <i>The Justice League, the Titans.</i>

00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:15.482
But, Cat, the point of
my editorial

00:02:15.484 --> 00:02:17.951
is to say that
it's time for human beings

00:02:17.953 --> 00:02:20.488
to stop relying on
Leagues and Titans,

00:02:20.490 --> 00:02:23.123
and start saving ourselves.

00:02:23.125 --> 00:02:25.691
So, we should each
be our own Superman?

00:02:25.693 --> 00:02:27.360
I mean, isn't that
exactly what

00:02:27.362 --> 00:02:28.563
these
guys are doing?

00:02:34.603 --> 00:02:36.235
Get a message
to Mannheim.

00:02:36.237 --> 00:02:39.972
Tell him, Snakey Doyle's
got the business in-hand.

00:02:39.974 --> 00:02:41.909
We'll see him in
five to ten.

00:03:04.098 --> 00:03:06.733
<i>Stop
fooling yourself, Cat.</i>

00:03:06.735 --> 00:03:09.335
The "Man of Steel" is dead.

00:03:09.337 --> 00:03:11.137
We saw the body.

00:03:11.139 --> 00:03:13.340
<i>Before it vanished.</i>

00:03:13.342 --> 00:03:16.409
<i>Look, we have no idea if
a Kryptonian can even die.</i>

00:03:16.411 --> 00:03:18.845
I mean, where's the body?

00:03:18.847 --> 00:03:20.616
<i>Who cares?</i>

00:03:37.498 --> 00:03:40.870
<i>The real questions
here are far more pressing.</i>

00:03:44.840 --> 00:03:47.210
<i>Who are these new guys?</i>

00:03:48.742 --> 00:03:51.245
<i>Why are they here?</i>

00:03:58.219 --> 00:04:00.286
<i>What is their place</i>

00:04:00.288 --> 00:04:02.791
<i>in a world without a Superman?</i>

00:04:23.178 --> 00:04:24.279
I hate it!

00:04:25.247 --> 00:04:26.579
Buck up, Troupe.

00:04:26.581 --> 00:04:28.315
Writing's fine,
just a crap headline.

00:04:28.317 --> 00:04:29.382
We'll fix it later.

00:04:29.384 --> 00:04:31.218
Now, I want angles!

00:04:31.220 --> 00:04:32.885
Sullivan?

00:04:32.887 --> 00:04:34.488
Law enforcement angle.

00:04:34.490 --> 00:04:36.990
Crime stats. "Have the
Supermen made us safer?"

00:04:36.992 --> 00:04:39.591
I love it. Change "Law
enforcement" to "Millennials"

00:04:39.593 --> 00:04:41.161
and "Crime stats"
to "Re-tweets."

00:04:41.163 --> 00:04:43.596
Are the Supermen trending?
Troupe?

00:04:43.598 --> 00:04:46.666
I was gonna go cover the
LexCorp charity gala tonight.

00:04:46.668 --> 00:04:48.668
Wrong.
You're covering the big launch

00:04:48.670 --> 00:04:50.536
of the Justice League's
Watchtower.

00:04:50.538 --> 00:04:52.938
Have the new
Supermen been invited?

00:04:52.940 --> 00:04:54.740
Lombard?

00:04:54.742 --> 00:04:57.478
Uh, I... I don't really
think there's a sports angle here.

00:04:57.480 --> 00:04:58.781
I love it! Kent?

00:05:03.286 --> 00:05:05.284
I meant
the Kent angle.

00:05:05.286 --> 00:05:08.421
"Missing persons following
the Doomsday attack."

00:05:08.423 --> 00:05:10.856
"The search for survivors."

00:05:10.858 --> 00:05:13.293
I think Lois
is covering it, Chief.

00:05:13.295 --> 00:05:14.793
Don't call me "Chief."

00:05:14.795 --> 00:05:16.098
Lane, what have you got?

00:05:19.100 --> 00:05:21.301
Great Caesar's ghost!

00:05:21.303 --> 00:05:23.138
Where
the hell's Lois Lane?

00:06:01.375 --> 00:06:03.209
It's okay, Lois.

00:06:03.211 --> 00:06:04.312
We've got you.

00:06:07.514 --> 00:06:09.414
Jimmy packed up his desk.

00:06:09.416 --> 00:06:13.952
He has a box, but I haven't
been to the <i>Planet</i> since...

00:06:13.954 --> 00:06:16.257
When I'm there, it just
reminds me that he isn't.

00:06:17.826 --> 00:06:19.293
I should've called.

00:06:19.295 --> 00:06:21.060
I wanted to.

00:06:21.062 --> 00:06:23.930
I'm just glad
he finally fessed up.

00:06:23.932 --> 00:06:27.103
It was such a big secret
to keep from you.

00:06:29.838 --> 00:06:32.038
I loved him too.

00:06:32.040 --> 00:06:34.944
- I tried to tell him, but...
- Oh, honey...

00:06:35.410 --> 00:06:36.646
He knew.

00:06:37.745 --> 00:06:40.279
I just...
I can't believe he's gone.

00:06:40.281 --> 00:06:43.416
He might not be if you
watch that damn Grant woman.

00:06:43.418 --> 00:06:44.651
Jonathan!

00:06:44.653 --> 00:06:46.320
Clark's body disappears,

00:06:46.322 --> 00:06:50.322
and suddenly these new Supermen
show up out of the blue.

00:06:50.324 --> 00:06:54.394
What if one of them
really is Clark reborn?

00:06:54.396 --> 00:06:56.296
Not possible.

00:06:56.298 --> 00:06:57.829
I would know.

00:06:57.831 --> 00:07:00.401
Of course. I just mean...

00:07:00.403 --> 00:07:02.838
There are a lot of
unanswered questions.

00:07:04.338 --> 00:07:06.873
When Superman first
showed up in Metropolis,

00:07:06.875 --> 00:07:08.375
nobody knew
what to make of him,

00:07:08.377 --> 00:07:10.413
because nobody knew
what to ask him.

00:07:12.047 --> 00:07:13.416
I knew what to ask him.

00:07:15.817 --> 00:07:17.786
I know what to ask these guys!

00:07:19.420 --> 00:07:21.353
I'm sorry, I gotta go.

00:07:33.401 --> 00:07:34.769
I'm glad you called.

00:07:35.603 --> 00:07:37.303
I'm glad you came.

00:07:37.305 --> 00:07:39.505
I was hoping
you could help me.

00:07:39.507 --> 00:07:42.711
- I'm following...
- I never thought of us as rivals, you know.

00:07:44.146 --> 00:07:46.012
Are we?

00:07:46.014 --> 00:07:48.182
Kal-El and I
had a special bond,

00:07:48.184 --> 00:07:51.250
but you were
the love of Clark Kent's life.

00:07:51.252 --> 00:07:56.356
Anyway, I'm relieved he
finally told you everything.

00:07:56.358 --> 00:07:57.893
Apparently he didn't.

00:07:59.793 --> 00:08:01.527
I'm sorry. For an Amazon,

00:08:01.529 --> 00:08:04.663
I have surprisingly
few girl friends here.

00:08:04.665 --> 00:08:06.632
So, I'm bad at this.

00:08:06.634 --> 00:08:09.471
It's okay. I don't have
many girl friends either.

00:08:11.740 --> 00:08:13.539
Anyway, the reason
I called is that

00:08:13.541 --> 00:08:15.974
I'm following the story
on the new Supermen

00:08:15.976 --> 00:08:17.909
and I was hoping that

00:08:17.911 --> 00:08:20.613
you or the League might have some
inside information on these guys.

00:08:20.615 --> 00:08:23.082
Anonymous, deep background,

00:08:23.084 --> 00:08:26.118
just to help me
direct my efforts.

00:08:26.120 --> 00:08:29.555
So, you didn't invite me here
to grieve with you?

00:08:29.557 --> 00:08:31.324
As friends?

00:08:31.326 --> 00:08:32.795
Not really, no.

00:08:34.596 --> 00:08:36.396
Thank Hera!

00:08:36.398 --> 00:08:39.534
Despite my reputation, I'm not
good at being touchy-feely.

00:08:41.201 --> 00:08:44.036
Lois, I don't have anything
for you on the Supermen.

00:08:44.038 --> 00:08:45.537
I wish I did.

00:08:45.539 --> 00:08:47.172
Off the record,

00:08:47.174 --> 00:08:50.211
the League's been stretched
very thin since we lost Kal.

00:08:51.379 --> 00:08:52.912
I don't think
the world realized

00:08:52.914 --> 00:08:54.449
how much they
depended on him.

00:08:55.817 --> 00:08:57.182
I know the feeling.

00:08:57.184 --> 00:08:59.319
No. I'm sorry, Lois.

00:08:59.321 --> 00:09:00.887
- I didn't...
- That's fine.

00:09:00.889 --> 00:09:02.388
Really.

00:09:02.390 --> 00:09:05.425
It feels good to talk to
someone who understands.

00:09:05.427 --> 00:09:07.560
I'm sorry to bother you
about the new Supermen.

00:09:07.562 --> 00:09:08.563
Forget I asked.

00:09:09.631 --> 00:09:10.964
Just between us,

00:09:10.966 --> 00:09:13.967
I like the brutal one
with the visor.

00:09:13.969 --> 00:09:17.039
But apparently I have a type.

00:09:18.539 --> 00:09:21.176
Anything else I can
get for you lovely ladies?

00:09:27.282 --> 00:09:29.015
Ice cream.

00:09:29.017 --> 00:09:30.782
Hmm.
Maybe you're not so bad

00:09:30.784 --> 00:09:32.551
at the girl friend
thing after all.

00:09:32.553 --> 00:09:34.186
And you, Lois Lane,

00:09:34.188 --> 00:09:35.957
have the heart of an Amazon.

00:09:37.793 --> 00:09:40.225
So, you wanna share a ride?

00:09:40.227 --> 00:09:42.627
Thanks,
I've kinda got my own.

00:09:42.629 --> 00:09:43.932
Would you mind?

00:09:51.440 --> 00:09:55.108
We should
do this again sometime.

00:09:55.110 --> 00:09:57.109
Lois, I know
in order to heal,

00:09:57.111 --> 00:09:59.478
you need to solve the
mystery of these Supermen.

00:09:59.480 --> 00:10:02.283
Just make sure you don't
lose yourself in the process.

00:10:23.339 --> 00:10:24.403
Something wrong?

00:10:24.405 --> 00:10:26.973
No. Everything's on schedule.

00:10:26.975 --> 00:10:29.979
He's just a little...
Handsy for me.

00:10:31.011 --> 00:10:33.081
He must get that
from you, Donovan.

00:10:43.524 --> 00:10:44.958
Lois Lane?

00:10:44.960 --> 00:10:46.725
John Henry Irons.

00:10:46.727 --> 00:10:48.161
You interviewed me once.

00:10:48.163 --> 00:10:51.100
Uh,
Dr. Irons! Right.

00:10:59.340 --> 00:11:01.377
I'm sorry,
would you excuse me?

00:11:02.977 --> 00:11:04.512
And there's my cue.

00:11:12.953 --> 00:11:14.753
Ladies and gentlemen,

00:11:14.755 --> 00:11:18.992
once again, I want to thank you
all for giving so generously.

00:11:18.994 --> 00:11:22.261
Together, we will
rebuild our great city,

00:11:22.263 --> 00:11:26.201
and ensure that we never
wake to another Doomsday.

00:11:27.836 --> 00:11:29.502
You've seen him in the news,

00:11:29.504 --> 00:11:33.506
but you didn't know who was
bankrolling him until now.

00:11:33.508 --> 00:11:35.108
Ladies and gents,

00:11:35.110 --> 00:11:40.046
I give you LexCorps'
new Superman!

00:12:04.172 --> 00:12:06.339
Hello, ladies!

00:12:06.341 --> 00:12:08.407
If you want a hero
who can measure up,

00:12:08.409 --> 00:12:10.142
- I can...
- And I promise you

00:12:10.144 --> 00:12:12.078
that as long as
LexCorp exists,

00:12:12.080 --> 00:12:14.748
Superman lives.

00:12:14.750 --> 00:12:17.483
Metropolis will be protected.

00:13:01.096 --> 00:13:03.599
Um, party's back that way.

00:13:04.865 --> 00:13:06.567
Oh, hello!

00:13:07.735 --> 00:13:08.736
Hello.

00:13:09.504 --> 00:13:11.373
I was looking for someone.

00:13:14.775 --> 00:13:16.577
Mr. Donovan.

00:13:22.583 --> 00:13:24.052
Not here.

00:13:30.926 --> 00:13:33.395
You look familiar.

00:13:36.899 --> 00:13:39.098
You don't look
so bad yourself.

00:13:39.100 --> 00:13:40.932
Do you work down here?

00:13:40.934 --> 00:13:42.234
What do you do?

00:13:42.236 --> 00:13:44.105
Advanced genetics.

00:13:45.307 --> 00:13:47.806
Fragmenting
and manipulating DNA

00:13:47.808 --> 00:13:50.342
for molecular duplication

00:13:50.344 --> 00:13:52.314
and, ah, reproduction.

00:13:53.246 --> 00:13:56.549
Ooh! Sounds important.

00:13:56.551 --> 00:13:58.350
You don't think
a sophisticated clone

00:13:58.352 --> 00:14:02.356
like LexCorps' new Superman out
there, just happens on its own.

00:14:02.924 --> 00:14:04.424
Clone?

00:14:04.426 --> 00:14:05.761
That's right.

00:14:06.927 --> 00:14:08.460
Mr. Luthor.

00:14:08.462 --> 00:14:10.729
- I was just...
- Mouthing off.

00:14:10.731 --> 00:14:11.766
Again.

00:14:12.466 --> 00:14:14.267
Word of advice, Donovan.

00:14:14.269 --> 00:14:15.834
A man who can't keep secrets

00:14:15.836 --> 00:14:18.139
shouldn't sleep around
on his wife.

00:14:19.441 --> 00:14:21.373
Lex,
I swear, I didn't.

00:14:21.375 --> 00:14:24.278
Of course, you did.
And I'll deal with you later.

00:14:24.913 --> 00:14:26.115
Get out.

00:14:28.783 --> 00:14:30.150
Ms. Lane,

00:14:30.152 --> 00:14:31.884
I'm hurt.

00:14:31.886 --> 00:14:34.786
I always assumed once Superman
was out of the picture,

00:14:34.788 --> 00:14:36.855
you'd rebound with me.

00:14:38.225 --> 00:14:39.724
What the hell?

00:14:57.511 --> 00:14:59.145
What do you
think you're doing?

00:14:59.147 --> 00:15:00.546
At this moment,

00:15:00.548 --> 00:15:03.749
I am answering a question
posed by Lex Luthor.

00:15:03.751 --> 00:15:06.252
Okay. Well,
here's another one,

00:15:06.254 --> 00:15:08.655
Why the hell are you here?

00:15:08.657 --> 00:15:11.557
Lex Luthor is
a known criminal.

00:15:11.559 --> 00:15:14.459
Criminals must be
eradicated.

00:15:14.461 --> 00:15:16.195
- Thank you.
- For what?

00:15:33.480 --> 00:15:34.716
Get down!

00:15:36.951 --> 00:15:39.584
Why, Ms. Lane, you do care.

00:15:39.586 --> 00:15:41.219
Call off your clones, Lex!

00:15:41.221 --> 00:15:42.988
Only the boy is mine.

00:15:48.764 --> 00:15:49.831
Sorry, pal.

00:15:51.198 --> 00:15:52.500
Crash my party,

00:15:53.268 --> 00:15:54.469
you get bounced.

00:16:10.451 --> 00:16:13.686
You have been classified a
priority one criminal accessory.

00:16:13.688 --> 00:16:16.055
Surrender or be eradicated.

00:16:20.028 --> 00:16:21.326
Well, you've been classified

00:16:21.328 --> 00:16:23.764
a priority one dirt-bag,
so, there!

00:16:50.792 --> 00:16:52.492
Yeah!

00:16:52.494 --> 00:16:55.264
You better run!
Jerk!

00:17:00.769 --> 00:17:01.935
Uh-oh.

00:17:18.153 --> 00:17:19.652
Hey! I had that guy.

00:17:19.654 --> 00:17:22.555
By all means,
go to town, Superboy.

00:17:22.557 --> 00:17:24.358
It's Superman.

00:17:26.126 --> 00:17:29.295
Okay, we can
do this the easy way

00:17:29.297 --> 00:17:30.731
or the hard way.

00:17:55.789 --> 00:17:59.661
Surrender Luthor over
to Superman and this ends.

00:18:03.832 --> 00:18:05.000
That's enough.

00:18:09.069 --> 00:18:10.503
We may see it differently,

00:18:10.505 --> 00:18:11.703
but in the eyes of the law

00:18:11.705 --> 00:18:13.972
Lex Luthor is not a criminal.

00:18:13.974 --> 00:18:17.309
The rule of law is
a rule you never break.

00:18:17.311 --> 00:18:19.679
And real justice
is everyone's right.

00:18:19.681 --> 00:18:22.314
Even the worst among us.

00:18:22.316 --> 00:18:24.119
Now, who the hell are you?

00:18:25.086 --> 00:18:26.454
I'm Superman.

00:18:28.222 --> 00:18:30.125
There is only one Superman.

00:19:50.471 --> 00:19:52.270
Oh! No problemo.

00:19:52.272 --> 00:19:54.006
Just doin' my job.

00:19:54.008 --> 00:19:56.441
Like the boss says,
as long as LexCorp exists,

00:19:56.443 --> 00:19:58.044
Superman lives.

00:19:58.046 --> 00:19:59.277
And I'm Superman.

00:19:59.279 --> 00:20:00.546
Me.

00:20:00.548 --> 00:20:02.248
There he is!
Over there.

00:20:02.250 --> 00:20:04.283
- Over there! Over there!
- That's him!

00:20:04.285 --> 00:20:07.622
Why are you here?

00:20:11.858 --> 00:20:14.162
Nice work in there. Thank you.

00:20:15.297 --> 00:20:16.362
He got away.

00:20:16.364 --> 00:20:18.130
Yeah, so did we.

00:20:18.132 --> 00:20:19.868
What happened to
the man in steel?

00:20:21.102 --> 00:20:22.103
He took off.

00:20:23.371 --> 00:20:25.040
<i>Lois Lane. Daily Planet.</i>

00:20:27.474 --> 00:20:29.743
So, how old are you?

00:20:30.944 --> 00:20:32.312
Excuse me?

00:20:32.314 --> 00:20:33.680
How old are you?

00:20:33.682 --> 00:20:34.950
Old enough.

00:20:37.317 --> 00:20:38.686
Okay, babe. Hit me up.

00:20:41.088 --> 00:20:42.890
That was revolting.

00:20:45.526 --> 00:20:46.892
So do you mind telling me

00:20:46.894 --> 00:20:48.563
what the heck you were
doing in that lab?

00:20:49.262 --> 00:20:51.063
I used to work there.

00:20:51.065 --> 00:20:53.365
I suspect Lex has been
using tech I developed

00:20:53.367 --> 00:20:56.268
to retrofit weapons
for the black market.

00:20:56.270 --> 00:20:59.037
What the heck were
you doing with Donovan?

00:20:59.039 --> 00:21:03.174
Finding out that
Superboy is a clone.

00:21:03.176 --> 00:21:06.946
<i>So why did you hide the fact that
your new Superman is actually a clone?</i>

00:21:06.948 --> 00:21:08.913
<i>I never said
he wasn't a clone.</i>

00:21:08.915 --> 00:21:10.748
<i>I said he's Superman.</i>

00:21:10.750 --> 00:21:14.319
<i>And he is a Superman clone.</i>

00:21:14.321 --> 00:21:15.856
<i>Now, if you'll excuse me.</i>

00:21:20.295 --> 00:21:22.061
<i>Do we wake him?</i>

00:21:22.063 --> 00:21:23.962
<i>No.</i>

00:21:23.964 --> 00:21:27.232
<i>Kal-El's last battle
left him severely depleted.</i>

00:21:27.234 --> 00:21:30.204
<i>We must not interrupt
his ion radiation transfer.</i>

00:21:40.047 --> 00:21:42.381
<i>Lane's not explicitly
calling them fakes.</i>

00:21:42.383 --> 00:21:45.218
She's asking the questions
that need to be asked.

00:21:45.220 --> 00:21:47.953
After her stunning
LexCorp clone expose,

00:21:47.955 --> 00:21:49.223
<i>she's got our attention.</i>

00:21:52.559 --> 00:21:53.928
Hello, Ms. Lane.

00:21:56.298 --> 00:21:58.098
I guess you got my message?

00:21:58.798 --> 00:22:00.499
The whole city did.

00:22:00.501 --> 00:22:02.971
I feel terrible we
haven't been able to talk yet.

00:22:05.073 --> 00:22:06.074
On the record?

00:22:07.174 --> 00:22:09.009
But I thought
you'd be happy to see me.

00:22:09.911 --> 00:22:11.509
See who?

00:22:11.511 --> 00:22:13.147
I don't know who you are.

00:22:13.815 --> 00:22:15.182
Lois, it's me!

00:22:16.550 --> 00:22:18.517
You look like Superman,

00:22:18.519 --> 00:22:20.020
but Superman died.

00:22:20.821 --> 00:22:22.122
In my arms.

00:22:23.223 --> 00:22:24.390
I did.

00:22:24.392 --> 00:22:25.724
For my people,

00:22:25.726 --> 00:22:27.826
death doesn't
have to be the end.

00:22:27.828 --> 00:22:30.729
Our technology was...
Is...

00:22:30.731 --> 00:22:33.798
Far beyond what
exists on Earth today.

00:22:33.800 --> 00:22:36.605
Part of that technology
is encoded in my genome.

00:22:37.337 --> 00:22:39.171
Before I died,

00:22:39.173 --> 00:22:42.309
I was able to activate it so that
it could rebuild and revive me.

00:22:43.411 --> 00:22:45.178
As a robot?

00:22:45.180 --> 00:22:46.444
I'm not a robot.

00:22:46.446 --> 00:22:49.347
These are just
artificial replacement parts.

00:22:49.349 --> 00:22:51.151
A cyborg Superman?

00:22:52.119 --> 00:22:53.687
Just Superman.

00:22:55.522 --> 00:22:56.757
Okay.

00:22:57.625 --> 00:22:59.160
What was your last secret?

00:23:00.528 --> 00:23:02.027
I don't know.

00:23:02.029 --> 00:23:05.264
Half my memories are gone
along with the rest of me.

00:23:05.266 --> 00:23:07.402
Then tell me
what you do remember.

00:23:08.801 --> 00:23:11.972
I remember we were close.

00:23:14.375 --> 00:23:16.475
How close?

00:23:16.477 --> 00:23:20.081
Enough that it hurts to have you
look at me like I'm a monster.

00:23:23.417 --> 00:23:25.183
The way you wrote about me...

00:23:25.185 --> 00:23:27.688
I never dreamed
I'd lose you like this.

00:23:28.788 --> 00:23:31.158
Especially not now when...

00:23:33.661 --> 00:23:35.661
Terrible things
are coming, Lois.

00:23:35.663 --> 00:23:37.196
I can feel it.

00:23:37.198 --> 00:23:39.265
When the <i>Daily Planet</i>
said "Superman is dead,"

00:23:39.267 --> 00:23:41.803
it painted
a target on the Earth.

00:23:42.769 --> 00:23:44.372
Why did you come here?

00:23:45.439 --> 00:23:47.640
Because I need your voice.

00:23:47.642 --> 00:23:51.176
I can't protect the people if
they think I'm a fake, Lois.

00:23:51.178 --> 00:23:52.978
Even if you won't
believe I'm Superman

00:23:52.980 --> 00:23:55.784
at least believe that
I'm trying to do some good.

00:23:58.420 --> 00:24:00.087
And maybe write about that.

00:24:57.577 --> 00:24:59.247
Get in.

00:25:03.317 --> 00:25:05.182
Just like you would
any new product.

00:25:05.184 --> 00:25:07.318
So far, all you've
managed to do is

00:25:07.320 --> 00:25:09.456
preen, and gallivant, and...

00:25:11.424 --> 00:25:12.826
Stop that!

00:25:13.794 --> 00:25:15.026
Where's Mercy?

00:25:15.028 --> 00:25:17.863
Still in traction,
thanks to you.

00:25:17.865 --> 00:25:19.264
Have you seen the newspapers?

00:25:19.266 --> 00:25:21.432
Yeah, I've seen them
all over the place.

00:25:21.434 --> 00:25:23.270
Have you read them?

00:25:26.740 --> 00:25:28.175
Oh. Right on!

00:25:31.378 --> 00:25:33.978
This really reflects
more on you.

00:25:33.980 --> 00:25:36.149
Do you know
what they're calling you?

00:25:36.151 --> 00:25:37.783
Superboy.

00:25:37.785 --> 00:25:40.419
But I'm Superman.

00:25:40.421 --> 00:25:43.221
They didn't get the memo.

00:25:43.223 --> 00:25:46.592
This entire roll-out
has been a disaster.

00:25:46.594 --> 00:25:49.527
Goggles and the robot are
getting all the good press.

00:25:49.529 --> 00:25:53.431
While you're strutting across
TV screens like a clown.

00:25:53.433 --> 00:25:54.767
Don't you mean clone?

00:25:54.769 --> 00:25:57.036
Thanks for
the heads-up, by the way.

00:25:57.038 --> 00:25:58.569
Oh, please.

00:25:58.571 --> 00:26:00.905
So you were genetically engineered.
Who isn't?

00:26:00.907 --> 00:26:04.008
Little DNA from here, some from there.
Bam! You're born.

00:26:04.010 --> 00:26:05.212
<i>Mazel tov!</i>

00:26:07.381 --> 00:26:10.181
The only difference between
you and a biological child

00:26:10.183 --> 00:26:12.784
is that I've invested
a hell of a lot more capital

00:26:12.786 --> 00:26:14.389
to bring you to the party.

00:26:19.125 --> 00:26:21.461
So, we are
going to start again.

00:26:22.029 --> 00:26:23.828
It's a relaunch.

00:26:23.830 --> 00:26:27.434
Superman 2.0.1.

00:26:29.569 --> 00:26:30.936
That's awful,

00:26:30.938 --> 00:26:33.238
but we'll let marketing
sort it all out.

00:26:33.240 --> 00:26:36.040
What do you
want me to do?

00:26:36.042 --> 00:26:38.309
You've had your fun,
Superboy,

00:26:38.311 --> 00:26:40.848
but now it's time
to act like a man.

00:26:41.481 --> 00:26:42.884
I got you a gig.

00:26:53.559 --> 00:26:55.495
They just passed
Burnett Boulevard.

00:26:57.064 --> 00:26:58.896
Coming up on Rodeo.

00:26:58.898 --> 00:27:01.033
I think they say Ro-day-o.

00:27:01.035 --> 00:27:02.366
They're wrong.

00:27:02.368 --> 00:27:03.535
Lantern?

00:27:04.904 --> 00:27:06.639
Yeah, I say Ro-day-o.

00:27:06.641 --> 00:27:08.172
- <i>Report!</i>
- Oh!

00:27:08.174 --> 00:27:10.941
Smooth
sailing up here. Flash?

00:27:12.713 --> 00:27:14.814
- I just wanna ask.
- <i>Ah, here it comes.</i>

00:27:14.816 --> 00:27:15.948
I'm just saying.

00:27:15.950 --> 00:27:17.183
Are we
presidential bodyguards,

00:27:18.249 --> 00:27:19.852
or are we the Justice League?

00:27:19.854 --> 00:27:21.686
Today, we're bodyguards.

00:27:21.688 --> 00:27:24.055
And you don't think there's
other stuff we should be doing?

00:27:24.057 --> 00:27:25.559
The Titans have it covered.

00:27:26.461 --> 00:27:28.059
The teen Titans.

00:27:28.061 --> 00:27:31.096
Oh, yeah!
I feel good about that.

00:27:31.098 --> 00:27:33.567
Chillax, Zippy.
The Titans are cool.

00:27:34.269 --> 00:27:35.334
Zippy?

00:27:35.336 --> 00:27:37.070
Wait.
Did he just say "Chillax"?

00:27:38.438 --> 00:27:40.271
Young man,
stay off this frequency.

00:27:40.273 --> 00:27:42.007
It's for League members only.

00:27:42.009 --> 00:27:44.209
No, it's for the
President's protective detail.

00:27:44.211 --> 00:27:46.745
As the new head
of LexCorp global security,

00:27:46.747 --> 00:27:48.082
I qualify.

00:27:50.017 --> 00:27:51.952
I have the shot.

00:27:52.685 --> 00:27:54.152
I say take it.

00:27:54.154 --> 00:27:55.754
That's enough.

00:27:55.756 --> 00:27:57.757
We have a job to do.

00:27:57.759 --> 00:27:59.458
Okay. Can we speed this up,

00:27:59.460 --> 00:28:01.930
because if I'm not home by
dinner, Iris is gonna kill me.

00:28:37.631 --> 00:28:39.434
Someone should go say hi.

00:28:41.634 --> 00:28:43.637
I'm a
little busy right now.

00:28:46.272 --> 00:28:50.441
I don't really know him. Vic?

00:28:50.443 --> 00:28:52.878
Oh, so you think
all cyborgs know each other?

00:28:52.880 --> 00:28:54.879
Yes. But, in my defense,

00:28:54.881 --> 00:28:56.148
I'm horribly insensitive.

00:28:57.551 --> 00:28:58.949
Lex is so wrong.

00:28:58.951 --> 00:29:00.684
You guys are funky fresh.

00:29:00.686 --> 00:29:02.353
<i>Donovan's
been letting you watch</i>

00:29:02.355 --> 00:29:04.588
<i>those 90s
sitcoms again, I see.</i>

00:29:04.590 --> 00:29:05.590
Lex?

00:29:05.592 --> 00:29:07.392
<i>I'm in your</i> other <i>ear.</i>

00:29:07.394 --> 00:29:09.393
<i>Reminding you to stay alert.</i>

00:29:09.395 --> 00:29:11.662
President Dale
has her eye on you.

00:29:11.664 --> 00:29:13.297
Keep her safe.

00:29:13.299 --> 00:29:16.101
By the end of the week, with a
little political maneuvering,

00:29:16.103 --> 00:29:18.237
she'll be
publicly recognizing you

00:29:18.239 --> 00:29:21.308
<i>as the one true Superman.</i>

00:29:24.144 --> 00:29:26.210
Yesterday, my husband said,

00:29:26.212 --> 00:29:28.747
"Joan, why do you
have to do this?"

00:29:28.749 --> 00:29:30.649
And I said,

00:29:30.651 --> 00:29:34.486
"Because I stand with the Justice
League as they have stood with us."

00:29:36.022 --> 00:29:38.123
Really, I'm trilled to be here.

00:29:38.125 --> 00:29:39.357
To help dedicate

00:29:39.359 --> 00:29:42.061
the Justice League's
new Watchtower.

00:29:42.063 --> 00:29:43.595
A proud...

00:29:49.869 --> 00:29:51.036
Madam President...

00:29:52.105 --> 00:29:53.471
I've got you, ma'am.

00:29:53.473 --> 00:29:55.108
I've got her, everyone!

00:30:01.347 --> 00:30:03.015
Uh, Lois?

00:30:03.017 --> 00:30:04.818
Everybody clear out!

00:30:08.722 --> 00:30:12.690
Kid, if I find out LexCorp had
anything to do with this...

00:30:12.692 --> 00:30:15.260
Look, Mr. Roboto,
we got bigger problems.

00:30:15.262 --> 00:30:16.496
The boy's right.

00:30:18.732 --> 00:30:20.231
Let's go.

00:31:07.146 --> 00:31:10.114
Watch your step.
Come on. No rush.

00:31:12.385 --> 00:31:13.852
Uh,
a little rush, actually.

00:31:26.232 --> 00:31:27.465
Hey, metal head!

00:31:27.467 --> 00:31:28.803
You wanna lend a hand?

00:32:08.843 --> 00:32:10.141
Superman?

00:32:10.143 --> 00:32:12.480
At your service,
Madam President.

00:32:15.383 --> 00:32:16.951
Time to get you out of here.

00:33:14.641 --> 00:33:16.173
<i>We're still reeling from
the latest alien attack,</i>

00:33:16.175 --> 00:33:18.744
<i>and the devastating loss
of the Justice League.</i>

00:33:18.746 --> 00:33:20.711
<i>President Dale will
speak at a memorial</i>

00:33:20.713 --> 00:33:22.881
<i>in Centennial Park
to honor the fallen.</i>

00:33:22.883 --> 00:33:25.449
<i>Alongside the man
whose heroic actions</i>

00:33:25.451 --> 00:33:26.950
<i>have proven to us all</i>

00:33:26.952 --> 00:33:30.689
<i>that he truly is
Superman reborn.</i>

00:33:30.691 --> 00:33:32.356
<i>And let me just say,</i>

00:33:32.358 --> 00:33:34.426
<i>it feels good
to have him back.</i>

00:33:37.998 --> 00:33:39.033
Couldn't find the remote?

00:33:40.300 --> 00:33:42.467
That
is not Superman.

00:33:42.469 --> 00:33:44.902
We had a real
opportunity here!

00:33:44.904 --> 00:33:46.371
A real opportunity,

00:33:46.373 --> 00:33:47.942
and you blew it!

00:33:52.212 --> 00:33:53.411
Come along, son.

00:33:55.781 --> 00:33:56.850
Lex, is...

00:33:58.617 --> 00:34:02.689
Hey, I did what you told me to do.
Everything I'm capable of doing.

00:34:04.090 --> 00:34:06.059
And you still lost.

00:34:09.463 --> 00:34:12.130
I gave you every
advantage Superman had,

00:34:12.132 --> 00:34:14.032
and more.

00:34:14.034 --> 00:34:15.200
And I appreciate...

00:34:15.202 --> 00:34:16.900
Wait, more?

00:34:16.902 --> 00:34:17.937
Wait here.

00:34:25.077 --> 00:34:26.380
I remember this place.

00:34:27.380 --> 00:34:28.782
There you are.

00:34:30.650 --> 00:34:32.952
Dr. Donovan?
What happened to you?

00:34:33.954 --> 00:34:35.387
You father is a...

00:34:35.389 --> 00:34:36.590
Hard man.

00:34:43.163 --> 00:34:44.494
My father?

00:34:44.496 --> 00:34:46.097
Do you mean Superman?

00:34:46.099 --> 00:34:47.601
I don't work for Super...

00:34:48.501 --> 00:34:50.668
Oh, no.

00:34:50.670 --> 00:34:53.438
I thought he would've
told you. I, uh...

00:34:53.440 --> 00:34:54.606
I didn't mean to...

00:34:54.608 --> 00:34:56.410
Well, look who's talking.

00:34:58.012 --> 00:34:59.610
Again!

00:34:59.612 --> 00:35:01.914
Mr. Luthor, please!

00:35:01.916 --> 00:35:03.880
What's going on?

00:35:03.882 --> 00:35:06.450
It's all right, Dabney.
Tell him.

00:35:06.452 --> 00:35:08.420
What difference
could it make now?

00:35:08.422 --> 00:35:10.557
- I don't think I...
- Tell him!

00:35:12.525 --> 00:35:15.293
The DNA, your DNA,

00:35:15.295 --> 00:35:17.329
- its...
- Superman's.

00:35:17.331 --> 00:35:21.432
Yes, but also...

00:35:21.434 --> 00:35:23.570
I told you I gave you more.

00:35:25.972 --> 00:35:28.742
All of Superman's
strength, plus

00:35:29.442 --> 00:35:32.079
all the Luthor intellect.

00:35:33.614 --> 00:35:35.579
Supposedly.

00:35:35.581 --> 00:35:37.516
He just needs guidance.

00:35:37.518 --> 00:35:40.619
Please! We got so much
closer with this one

00:35:40.621 --> 00:35:42.088
than any of the others.

00:35:43.257 --> 00:35:44.590
You're right, Dabney.

00:35:44.592 --> 00:35:45.856
The current model really is

00:35:45.858 --> 00:35:48.927
leaps and bounds
ahead of his brothers.

00:35:48.929 --> 00:35:50.865
I don't know what I was thinking.

00:35:51.398 --> 00:35:52.700
Let's go.

00:36:01.275 --> 00:36:02.974
And Dabney,

00:36:02.976 --> 00:36:04.142
you're fired.

00:36:22.228 --> 00:36:24.695
No! No!

00:36:27.934 --> 00:36:29.903
Still can't keep
his mouth shut.

00:37:00.266 --> 00:37:04.135
If you're through indulging
in this emotional nonsense,

00:37:04.137 --> 00:37:05.706
we have work to do,

00:37:06.940 --> 00:37:08.174
Superman.

00:37:11.679 --> 00:37:14.545
Yes, master.

00:37:21.487 --> 00:37:22.820
It was him.

00:37:22.822 --> 00:37:24.692
Well, half of him, anyway.

00:37:25.391 --> 00:37:27.227
Was he with anyone else?

00:37:28.295 --> 00:37:29.663
Only her.

00:37:35.235 --> 00:37:37.302
Terri Henshaw.

00:37:37.304 --> 00:37:39.470
He was pretty out of it.

00:37:39.472 --> 00:37:40.871
Stood there half the night

00:37:40.873 --> 00:37:42.740
talkin' to the air.

00:37:42.742 --> 00:37:45.610
Looked tormented.

00:37:45.612 --> 00:37:48.749
'Course, that's not
unusual around here.

00:37:50.550 --> 00:37:52.119
It is for Superman.

00:38:34.228 --> 00:38:35.693
It's about time
you showed up.

00:38:35.695 --> 00:38:37.195
What the...

00:38:37.197 --> 00:38:38.963
Yeah, you shouldn't leave
your bathroom window open.

00:38:38.965 --> 00:38:40.568
Anyone could get in here.

00:38:42.902 --> 00:38:44.568
So, I got a lead
at the cemetery

00:38:44.570 --> 00:38:46.104
that I think we should...

00:38:46.106 --> 00:38:48.240
John?

00:38:48.242 --> 00:38:51.108
You know that
I know you're Steel, right?

00:38:51.110 --> 00:38:53.545
And I'm literally the
worst at secret identities.

00:38:53.547 --> 00:38:55.315
I mean,
if you couldn't fool me...

00:38:57.751 --> 00:39:00.184
Superman saved my life once.

00:39:00.186 --> 00:39:01.885
Now that he's gone,

00:39:01.887 --> 00:39:03.755
I owe it to him
to fill the void.

00:39:12.699 --> 00:39:14.699
Neat!

00:39:14.701 --> 00:39:16.266
What did you find
at the cemetery?

00:39:19.172 --> 00:39:22.639
Terri Henshaw?
The astronaut?

00:39:22.641 --> 00:39:24.441
She was on
the Excalibur, right?

00:39:24.443 --> 00:39:28.079
Yup. Can you access the S.T.A.R.
Labs' mainframe from here?

00:39:29.148 --> 00:39:30.682
If the cyborg's
telling the truth,

00:39:30.684 --> 00:39:32.083
that he really is Superman,

00:39:32.085 --> 00:39:34.586
then why would he
go to Terri Henshaw's grave?

00:39:34.588 --> 00:39:36.019
This is odd.

00:39:36.021 --> 00:39:38.923
It says Henshaw's remains
were never recovered.

00:39:38.925 --> 00:39:42.425
Sorry. Remains were
recovered for Terri Henshaw,

00:39:42.427 --> 00:39:44.494
but not for Hank Henshaw.

00:39:44.496 --> 00:39:45.762
The Henshaws.

00:39:45.764 --> 00:39:47.100
Of course!

00:39:48.168 --> 00:39:49.700
The husband
and wife astronauts.

00:39:49.702 --> 00:39:51.068
We did a huge story on them.

00:39:51.070 --> 00:39:53.237
They were both
assigned to the Excalibur.

00:39:53.239 --> 00:39:56.706
So, it was the husband's body
that was never found.

00:39:56.708 --> 00:39:58.275
It's him, John.

00:39:58.277 --> 00:40:00.811
It's why he was
visiting Terri's grave.

00:40:00.813 --> 00:40:02.179
I don't know how,

00:40:02.181 --> 00:40:05.418
but the cyborg Superman
is Hank Henshaw.

00:40:29.108 --> 00:40:30.074
Huh?

00:40:37.916 --> 00:40:39.219
Superman?

00:40:47.092 --> 00:40:48.226
I...

00:40:48.228 --> 00:40:49.463
I don't think...

00:40:57.304 --> 00:41:00.505
The Justice League
were the best among us.

00:41:00.507 --> 00:41:03.541
As such, they would
want us to celebrate today.

00:41:03.543 --> 00:41:04.976
Not mourn.

00:41:04.978 --> 00:41:06.577
Yet, here we are.

00:41:06.579 --> 00:41:09.947
Surrounded by reminders
in stone of the mournful times

00:41:09.949 --> 00:41:12.249
that have befallen our world.

00:41:12.251 --> 00:41:15.987
It's only by a miracle of alien
science that I am here today.

00:41:15.989 --> 00:41:20.325
Alive. Standing in for
the real heroes we lost

00:41:20.327 --> 00:41:22.360
During
the Doomsday battle,

00:41:22.362 --> 00:41:23.894
the Watchtower attack,

00:41:23.896 --> 00:41:26.197
and too many
other bloody incursions.

00:41:26.199 --> 00:41:28.633
We need to shut
this asshole down.

00:41:28.635 --> 00:41:31.269
How? He's Superman to them.

00:41:31.271 --> 00:41:34.338
I could try to pitch the Henshaw
story to Perry White, but

00:41:34.340 --> 00:41:37.407
without any evidence,
he won't go near it.

00:41:37.409 --> 00:41:39.043
...which is why today,

00:41:39.045 --> 00:41:42.947
I am announcing the establishment
of a new, stronger League.

00:41:42.949 --> 00:41:44.349
A Cyborg Corp,

00:41:44.351 --> 00:41:46.184
to honor those
who have perished

00:41:46.186 --> 00:41:47.988
in the name of justice,

00:41:48.688 --> 00:41:50.487
and by taking volunteers.

00:41:50.489 --> 00:41:53.526
What the hell?

00:41:54.795 --> 00:41:57.896
- I volunteer.
- What?

00:41:57.898 --> 00:41:59.833
But I don't have any power.

00:42:00.766 --> 00:42:02.266
No one has.

00:42:02.268 --> 00:42:04.235
Not really.

00:42:04.237 --> 00:42:07.039
But I can change all that
if you come forth.

00:42:08.307 --> 00:42:09.909
Eric, no!

00:42:10.543 --> 00:42:12.075
Becky, please.

00:42:12.077 --> 00:42:13.744
This could change everything.

00:42:13.746 --> 00:42:16.016
For the world, for us.

00:42:22.856 --> 00:42:24.258
Welcome to the team.

00:42:38.271 --> 00:42:42.139
I can give each of you the
power to be your own hero.

00:42:42.141 --> 00:42:44.541
The same technology
that saved me,

00:42:44.543 --> 00:42:46.078
can save us all.

00:42:53.519 --> 00:42:56.320
Doomsday,
was only the beginning.

00:42:56.322 --> 00:42:58.655
Our enemies
haven't been destroyed.

00:42:58.657 --> 00:42:59.724
Only delayed.

00:42:59.726 --> 00:43:01.126
When they return,

00:43:01.128 --> 00:43:03.130
who will stand
and fight with me?

00:43:07.733 --> 00:43:09.967
This is it.
This is his plan.

00:43:09.969 --> 00:43:11.903
How the hell did Hank Henshaw

00:43:11.905 --> 00:43:13.905
get his hands
on that kinda tech?

00:43:13.907 --> 00:43:16.541
Intergang's been running
Luthor's Apokolips tech.

00:43:16.543 --> 00:43:17.943
I can get to them.

00:43:17.945 --> 00:43:20.077
Find out if they have
ties to Cyborg Superman.

00:43:20.079 --> 00:43:21.679
Sounds like a plan.

00:43:21.681 --> 00:43:23.349
I'll go lean on Lex.

00:44:04.023 --> 00:44:06.224
Take your time, boys.

00:44:06.226 --> 00:44:08.961
Ain't nobody watchin'
the store today.

00:44:21.742 --> 00:44:24.211
So you're saying that's
the way to Hob's Bay?

00:44:29.382 --> 00:44:30.748
Eric?

00:44:30.750 --> 00:44:32.052
Can you fly?

00:44:41.128 --> 00:44:43.096
Oh, come on!
Not again!

00:44:52.706 --> 00:44:54.704
I believe this belongs to you.

00:44:54.706 --> 00:44:56.175
My hero.

00:44:58.110 --> 00:45:00.811
Do you require
further assistance?

00:45:00.813 --> 00:45:02.615
Eric. It's me, Becky.

00:45:03.583 --> 00:45:04.581
Are you okay?

00:45:04.583 --> 00:45:07.584
I haven't heard
from you in days.

00:45:07.586 --> 00:45:10.454
Okay, stop it.
You're scaring me.

00:45:10.456 --> 00:45:13.657
Have a pleasant day, citizen.

00:45:13.659 --> 00:45:15.728
Eric? Eric!

00:45:29.108 --> 00:45:31.775
Doyle, I know you're here.

00:45:31.777 --> 00:45:33.411
I'm not looking for trouble.

00:45:33.413 --> 00:45:35.311
I just need information
on some alien tech

00:45:35.313 --> 00:45:36.549
you may have unloaded.

00:45:37.483 --> 00:45:38.485
What the hell?

00:45:45.858 --> 00:45:47.958
What happened here?

00:45:47.960 --> 00:45:49.729
Superman cleaned us out.

00:45:50.663 --> 00:45:51.998
The one in the shades.

00:45:52.764 --> 00:45:53.965
The eradicator?

00:45:53.967 --> 00:45:55.900
Here.

00:45:55.902 --> 00:45:58.070
Traces on our stuff.

00:45:59.438 --> 00:46:01.574
You can catch up with him
if you hurry.

00:46:03.108 --> 00:46:04.443
Go get him.

00:46:05.878 --> 00:46:07.246
Don't wait up.

00:46:19.759 --> 00:46:21.492
We both know
you took me down there

00:46:21.494 --> 00:46:23.360
to get rid of Superboy
for good.

00:46:23.362 --> 00:46:26.363
I don't know what
changed you mind, but...

00:46:29.168 --> 00:46:31.438
Oh. I thought you were...

00:46:32.204 --> 00:46:33.371
Let me guess.

00:46:33.373 --> 00:46:35.108
You thought I was Lex Luthor.

00:46:39.545 --> 00:46:42.345
Lookin' for ol' cue ball.
Know where he is, Superboy?

00:46:42.347 --> 00:46:43.750
Don't call me that!

00:46:52.090 --> 00:46:53.293
What's wrong?

00:46:54.025 --> 00:46:55.226
He's my father.

00:46:55.228 --> 00:46:58.563
At least, he's half my DNA.

00:46:58.565 --> 00:46:59.766
I just found out.

00:47:01.000 --> 00:47:02.333
Nah, I don't buy it.

00:47:02.335 --> 00:47:04.170
I mean, the hair alone.

00:47:07.172 --> 00:47:09.341
Wow. You do look like him.

00:47:10.043 --> 00:47:11.478
Superman, I mean.

00:47:14.280 --> 00:47:16.780
Look, I was a jerk
when I met you, Lois.

00:47:16.782 --> 00:47:17.784
I'm sorry.

00:47:18.983 --> 00:47:20.117
I don't know why, but

00:47:20.119 --> 00:47:21.688
I feel like I can talk to you.

00:47:24.123 --> 00:47:25.324
I know why.

00:47:30.530 --> 00:47:31.961
Yeah.

00:47:31.963 --> 00:47:33.565
<i>Eradicator's
gathering up Apokolips' tech.</i>

00:47:33.567 --> 00:47:35.833
<i>He could be
working with Henshaw.</i>

00:47:35.835 --> 00:47:37.333
<i>I'm tracking him now.</i>

00:47:37.335 --> 00:47:39.938
All right. Keep me posted.

00:48:10.735 --> 00:48:12.036
<i>Greetings.</i>

00:48:12.038 --> 00:48:14.838
Uh, greetings?

00:48:14.840 --> 00:48:16.441
<i>Kal-El is unavailable</i>

00:48:16.443 --> 00:48:19.077
<i>as he nears completion
of his revitalization cycle.</i>

00:48:19.079 --> 00:48:21.045
Thank you for your patience.

00:48:21.047 --> 00:48:22.780
Kal-El?

00:48:22.782 --> 00:48:24.882
So it really is you.

00:48:41.800 --> 00:48:42.967
Woah, Steel!

00:48:42.969 --> 00:48:44.202
What's happening?

00:48:44.204 --> 00:48:45.869
Little busy here, Lois.

00:48:45.871 --> 00:48:47.406
You called me.

00:48:48.074 --> 00:48:49.706
Sorry. Butt dial.

00:49:14.666 --> 00:49:16.702
What the hell
is going on, here?

00:49:17.469 --> 00:49:18.836
Give me that.

00:49:18.838 --> 00:49:19.970
Oh, don't!

00:49:27.612 --> 00:49:29.847
- Is that...
- Kal-El's ship!

00:49:29.849 --> 00:49:30.984
In S.T.A.R. Labs.

00:49:33.619 --> 00:49:35.952
He needs help. I'm going.

00:49:35.954 --> 00:49:37.019
No.

00:49:37.021 --> 00:49:38.356
These cyborg thingies

00:49:38.358 --> 00:49:40.124
are popping up
all over the city.

00:49:40.126 --> 00:49:42.392
It's gonna take a turn and I need you here.

00:49:42.394 --> 00:49:44.327
You're not the
boss of me, Lex.

00:49:44.329 --> 00:49:46.232
I literally am.

00:49:51.704 --> 00:49:54.171
You cannot harm
the data matrix.

00:49:54.173 --> 00:49:56.009
The data matrix?

00:50:01.981 --> 00:50:03.947
John! It's a hologram!

00:50:03.949 --> 00:50:05.951
It's designed to
protect Kryptonians.

00:50:07.653 --> 00:50:09.920
<i>I don't see any
Kryptonians around here.</i>

00:50:09.922 --> 00:50:10.923
<i>Do you?</i>

00:50:12.891 --> 00:50:14.191
Oh, my god!

00:50:14.193 --> 00:50:15.528
John, he's...

00:50:29.442 --> 00:50:32.275
These pitiful humans.

00:50:32.277 --> 00:50:35.146
Humbled by the demise
of their heroes,

00:50:35.148 --> 00:50:39.215
have willingly become
mindless automatons.

00:50:39.217 --> 00:50:42.355
My stratagem has
worked perfectly.

00:50:44.389 --> 00:50:47.324
Soon, Earth
will be christened

00:50:47.326 --> 00:50:50.827
by Darkseid as new Apokolips.

00:50:50.829 --> 00:50:52.229
And this time,

00:50:52.231 --> 00:50:54.432
there's no Justice League

00:50:54.434 --> 00:50:57.900
or Superman to stop me.

00:50:57.902 --> 00:51:00.939
All that remains is
for you to open the gates.

00:51:10.916 --> 00:51:12.950
All you gotta do is
look out the window

00:51:12.952 --> 00:51:14.888
to see things
ain't right no more.

00:51:15.954 --> 00:51:17.521
I knew Superman.

00:51:17.523 --> 00:51:19.423
Superman was my pal.

00:51:19.425 --> 00:51:22.495
And those things
ain't Supermen.

00:51:23.929 --> 00:51:27.331
They're not even
the people they used to be.

00:51:27.333 --> 00:51:30.900
I mean, at least
they're keeping the peace, right?

00:51:30.902 --> 00:51:33.269
You know that
ain't gonna last.

00:51:33.271 --> 00:51:34.704
We can't wait until

00:51:34.706 --> 00:51:36.807
after this thing takes
a turn for the worse.

00:51:36.809 --> 00:51:39.242
By then, it'll be too late!

00:51:39.244 --> 00:51:41.644
The robot said
one thing right.

00:51:41.646 --> 00:51:45.249
He said, "We gotta
be our own heroes."

00:51:45.251 --> 00:51:48.186
People are protesting
down at the Watchtower.

00:51:48.188 --> 00:51:49.954
Getting to be quite a crowd.

00:51:49.956 --> 00:51:52.088
What are we waitin' for?

00:51:52.090 --> 00:51:55.525
Together, we may not be
able to bring the beat down,

00:51:55.527 --> 00:51:58.229
but we sure as hell
can make some noise.

00:51:58.231 --> 00:51:59.432
Am I right?

00:52:26.090 --> 00:52:28.358
Last one for now.

00:52:28.360 --> 00:52:29.628
Any luck?

00:52:30.362 --> 00:52:31.595
No.

00:52:31.597 --> 00:52:33.130
Systems are
operating normally,

00:52:33.132 --> 00:52:35.599
but for some reason I can't
open a boom tube here.

00:52:35.601 --> 00:52:37.534
Any idea where here is?

00:52:37.536 --> 00:52:40.003
I don't recognize
any of these star formations.

00:52:40.005 --> 00:52:41.338
J'onn?

00:52:41.340 --> 00:52:42.972
They are foreign
to me as well.

00:52:42.974 --> 00:52:45.441
That's because
they're not stars.

00:52:45.443 --> 00:52:47.110
What are they?

00:52:50.182 --> 00:52:51.581
Hungry.

00:52:51.583 --> 00:52:53.115
I'm just gonna
hide behind the Amazon

00:52:53.117 --> 00:52:54.818
till Vic gets us home.

00:52:54.820 --> 00:52:56.086
There's nothin' doin', guys.

00:52:56.088 --> 00:52:57.720
Unless someone
from the other side

00:52:57.722 --> 00:52:59.491
reaches out to bring us back,

00:53:01.159 --> 00:53:02.561
we are home.

00:53:24.817 --> 00:53:26.849
You sure don't
hit like a hologram.

00:53:37.163 --> 00:53:41.134
Intruders must be...

00:53:50.543 --> 00:53:51.878
That's enough!

00:54:00.353 --> 00:54:01.784
Steel stopped transmitting.

00:54:01.786 --> 00:54:03.186
I can't find a signal.

00:54:03.188 --> 00:54:05.757
Even after redirecting
every LexCorp satellite.

00:54:06.425 --> 00:54:08.092
So,

00:54:08.094 --> 00:54:10.697
do you really think
Kal-El is alive?

00:54:12.231 --> 00:54:13.296
I don't know.

00:54:13.298 --> 00:54:15.231
But, for the first time,

00:54:15.233 --> 00:54:17.633
I really feel
like it's possible.

00:54:17.635 --> 00:54:19.172
For the first time,

00:54:20.239 --> 00:54:21.740
I hope he is.

00:54:23.976 --> 00:54:26.142
Now, there's something
you need to see.

00:54:39.925 --> 00:54:41.728
It's really you, isn't it?

00:54:43.429 --> 00:54:45.095
How?

00:54:45.097 --> 00:54:48.298
Honestly,
I don't know.

00:54:48.300 --> 00:54:52.101
The robots keep calling it
a revitalization cycle.

00:54:52.103 --> 00:54:55.271
But it's not something I'd ever
heard of or knew was possible.

00:54:57.909 --> 00:54:59.543
What is this place?

00:54:59.545 --> 00:55:01.010
A fortress.

00:55:01.012 --> 00:55:04.683
Built to keep me
isolated during this process.

00:55:07.186 --> 00:55:10.186
Does he have to
just stand there like that?

00:55:10.188 --> 00:55:11.755
It's creepin' me out.

00:55:11.757 --> 00:55:13.824
He's just
trying to protect me.

00:55:13.826 --> 00:55:15.559
Then why was he
drawing energy from you

00:55:15.561 --> 00:55:16.961
while you were in the pod?

00:55:16.963 --> 00:55:18.961
<i>Quite the reverse.</i>

00:55:18.963 --> 00:55:24.034
<i>Kal-El was the one absorbing ion
radiation from the Eradicator</i>

00:55:24.036 --> 00:55:26.802
<i>as part of
the revitalization cycle.</i>

00:55:26.804 --> 00:55:28.104
Highly advanced tech

00:55:28.106 --> 00:55:30.775
programmed to
protect my people.

00:55:30.777 --> 00:55:32.141
So, he decided
to put on a cape

00:55:32.143 --> 00:55:34.179
and dispense his
own brand of justice?

00:55:39.418 --> 00:55:40.786
I'm just saying.

00:55:44.190 --> 00:55:46.856
Well, I can't tell you how
glad I am to see you again.

00:55:46.858 --> 00:55:48.925
There's a lot
you need to know.

00:55:48.927 --> 00:55:51.461
These broadcasts have
brought me up-to-speed.

00:55:51.463 --> 00:55:53.130
Darkseid killed my friends,

00:55:53.132 --> 00:55:55.199
and people are
being turned into monsters

00:55:55.201 --> 00:55:57.133
by that cyborg impostor.

00:55:57.135 --> 00:55:58.704
Hank Henshaw.

00:55:59.804 --> 00:56:00.970
The astronaut?

00:56:00.972 --> 00:56:02.608
I thought he was dead.

00:56:04.041 --> 00:56:06.711
I guess I didn't
know everything.

00:56:06.713 --> 00:56:08.247
There's
a lot of that goin' around.

00:56:11.983 --> 00:56:14.186
So, what's the plan

00:56:15.320 --> 00:56:16.322
Dad?

00:56:22.628 --> 00:56:24.061
<i>And this time</i>

00:56:24.063 --> 00:56:26.063
<i>there's no Justice League</i>

00:56:26.065 --> 00:56:29.266
<i>or Superman to stop me.</i>

00:56:29.268 --> 00:56:33.137
<i>All that remains is
for you to open the gates.</i>

00:56:33.139 --> 00:56:35.037
Ever since the League's
"accident,"

00:56:35.039 --> 00:56:38.409
my satellites have intercepted
strange encoded signals.

00:56:38.411 --> 00:56:40.142
It's some kind of
holographic interface.

00:56:40.144 --> 00:56:43.780
Darkseid is beaming
directly into Henshaw's head.

00:56:43.782 --> 00:56:46.853
He's literally messing
with his mind.

00:56:47.920 --> 00:56:49.186
Once Superman was gone,

00:56:49.188 --> 00:56:50.954
he cleared out
the Justice League,

00:56:50.956 --> 00:56:53.289
created an army of cybernetic
minions, and now...

00:56:53.291 --> 00:56:56.092
They open the gates.

00:56:56.094 --> 00:56:59.429
How do we even
begin to fight that?

00:56:59.431 --> 00:57:01.197
I might have something.

00:57:01.199 --> 00:57:02.264
Is it a plan?

00:57:02.266 --> 00:57:04.635
Because, what we
really need is a plan.

00:57:04.637 --> 00:57:06.336
The plan is to stop Darkseid,

00:57:06.338 --> 00:57:07.970
and save Henshaw.

00:57:07.972 --> 00:57:10.307
And get the girl.
Slash girls.

00:57:10.309 --> 00:57:12.342
Until your regeneration
is complete,

00:57:12.344 --> 00:57:15.782
I must insist you abstain
from sexual activity.

00:57:16.882 --> 00:57:20.050
Um, all right?

00:57:20.052 --> 00:57:22.155
You're not fully
powered yet, are you?

00:57:24.255 --> 00:57:25.357
For how long?

00:57:26.559 --> 00:57:27.827
I don't know.

00:57:29.460 --> 00:57:30.762
Maybe forever.

00:57:33.865 --> 00:57:35.365
After Darkseid's
first invasion,

00:57:35.367 --> 00:57:36.733
you couldn't
walk down the street

00:57:36.735 --> 00:57:38.802
without tripping
over alien tech.

00:57:38.804 --> 00:57:41.708
Yeah,
tech that you gave Intergang.

00:57:42.775 --> 00:57:43.941
Gave?

00:57:43.943 --> 00:57:46.909
You really don't
get me, do you?

00:57:46.911 --> 00:57:49.012
And anyway,
you're welcome.

00:57:49.014 --> 00:57:50.713
Because that
business arrangement

00:57:50.715 --> 00:57:51.815
is what brought us...

00:57:55.353 --> 00:57:56.388
...this beauty.

00:57:57.856 --> 00:57:59.155
A motherbox?

00:57:59.157 --> 00:58:00.657
We just have to activate it

00:58:00.659 --> 00:58:03.559
outside the Watchtower
at exactly the right spot.

00:58:03.561 --> 00:58:06.729
Unfortunately, the tin man's
got eyes everywhere.

00:58:06.731 --> 00:58:08.398
One of us will
have to go inside

00:58:08.400 --> 00:58:09.733
and keep him occupied

00:58:09.735 --> 00:58:12.168
while the other turns this on.

00:58:12.170 --> 00:58:14.206
Okay. Show me how it works.

00:58:16.974 --> 00:58:18.208
Are you insane?

00:58:18.210 --> 00:58:21.047
I'm not going in there,
you are.

00:58:24.583 --> 00:58:25.782
Kal-El,

00:58:25.784 --> 00:58:27.818
I must insist on
accompanying you.

00:58:27.820 --> 00:58:29.653
Bad idea.

00:58:29.655 --> 00:58:31.090
This guy's a wild card.

00:58:36.762 --> 00:58:40.197
Maybe a wild card
is what we need.

00:58:40.199 --> 00:58:44.068
What we need is a way
to get you to Metropolis.

00:58:44.070 --> 00:58:46.905
It's 40 below outside,
and you're just a guy now.

00:58:51.110 --> 00:58:53.112
A guy with a spaceship.

00:59:09.494 --> 00:59:11.327
Slammin'!

00:59:11.329 --> 00:59:12.729
Excuse me?

00:59:12.731 --> 00:59:14.834
Do people not
say that anymore?

00:59:20.938 --> 00:59:23.542
We are not machines!

00:59:34.887 --> 00:59:36.422
Listen, Lane.

00:59:38.791 --> 00:59:41.059
- I just wanna say...
- Thank you?

00:59:41.827 --> 00:59:43.262
Don't screw up.

00:59:46.699 --> 00:59:49.101
Hey, you two.
Over here.

00:59:51.869 --> 00:59:53.205
Take me to your boss.

00:59:55.974 --> 00:59:59.876
Seriously. A room-full
of hungry bizarros.

00:59:59.878 --> 01:00:01.311
Sounds harrowing.

01:00:01.313 --> 01:00:03.246
So, can I
live with you or not?

01:00:03.248 --> 01:00:04.548
Guys, I'm getting
an incoming call

01:00:04.550 --> 01:00:06.583
from a LexCorp number.
Could be Lois.

01:00:06.585 --> 01:00:07.920
I'm bouncing it over.

01:00:10.856 --> 01:00:13.025
<i>Oh! It's you.</i>

01:00:14.527 --> 01:00:15.724
Lex Luthor.

01:00:15.726 --> 01:00:17.661
As I live and breathe.

01:00:17.663 --> 01:00:20.097
Yeah, what's that about?

01:00:20.099 --> 01:00:21.764
Where's Lois?

01:00:21.766 --> 01:00:23.066
<i>As much as I'd love to chat,</i>

01:00:23.068 --> 01:00:24.767
I'm only calling
to ask sonny boy

01:00:24.769 --> 01:00:27.470
<i>if he wouldn't mind
popping by for a stretch.</i>

01:00:27.472 --> 01:00:29.373
<i>I'm downtown
in the thick of it,</i>

01:00:29.375 --> 01:00:31.273
<i>and, well I could
use some muscle.</i>

01:00:31.275 --> 01:00:32.742
The boy stays with me,

01:00:32.744 --> 01:00:35.811
and I need to know now
that Lois is all right.

01:00:35.813 --> 01:00:37.046
Oh, she's fine.

01:00:37.048 --> 01:00:38.451
She's in the Watchtower.

01:00:39.284 --> 01:00:40.249
What?

01:00:45.456 --> 01:00:47.324
To
think that all this

01:00:47.326 --> 01:00:50.594
was made possible
when my Doomsday weapon.

01:00:50.596 --> 01:00:54.130
Obliterated your
primitive spacecraft.

01:00:54.132 --> 01:00:56.999
I plucked your
lifeless corpse from the void,

01:00:57.001 --> 01:01:00.005
and handed you
a chance for glory.

01:01:01.574 --> 01:01:03.206
Yes, your grace.

01:01:03.208 --> 01:01:06.344
And all because
a Kryptonian failed you.

01:01:08.713 --> 01:01:09.947
Even in death

01:01:09.949 --> 01:01:11.584
he will pay for his crimes.

01:01:13.184 --> 01:01:15.151
To capture glory, Henshaw,

01:01:15.153 --> 01:01:17.354
you must first
understand that sorrow,

01:01:17.356 --> 01:01:19.555
rage, and the thirst
for vengeance,

01:01:19.557 --> 01:01:22.628
are essential parts
of the equation.

01:01:23.295 --> 01:01:24.297
Sir?

01:01:25.931 --> 01:01:27.133
What now?

01:01:32.771 --> 01:01:34.105
Leave us.

01:01:40.077 --> 01:01:41.778
Dr. Frankenstein.

01:01:41.780 --> 01:01:43.546
Or is it his monster?

01:01:43.548 --> 01:01:44.983
So easy to get mixed up.

01:01:46.085 --> 01:01:48.253
Frankenstein wanted
to play god.

01:01:49.188 --> 01:01:51.023
Do I look like I'm playing?

01:01:51.956 --> 01:01:54.925
You're gonna lose, Hank.

01:01:54.927 --> 01:01:57.327
Hank Henshaw's dead.

01:01:57.329 --> 01:02:00.032
Just like your beloved
knight in blue tights.

01:02:04.469 --> 01:02:08.237
Of all the things I learned
on your balcony that night,

01:02:08.239 --> 01:02:09.873
I think the most important

01:02:09.875 --> 01:02:13.276
was the true nature of your
relationship with Superman.

01:02:13.278 --> 01:02:16.211
A relationship, I'm afraid,

01:02:16.213 --> 01:02:18.882
that's about to meet
a tragic end.

No! No! No!

01:02:38.202 --> 01:02:41.304
So, my Doomsday weapon failed,

01:02:41.306 --> 01:02:44.240
and the
Kryptonian still lives.

01:02:44.242 --> 01:02:46.376
Get out of my head!

01:02:48.746 --> 01:02:50.380
Yes!

01:02:50.382 --> 01:02:53.583
I shall enjoy
killing the man of steel

01:02:53.585 --> 01:02:55.217
all over again.

01:02:55.219 --> 01:02:59.322
This time, with my bare hands.

01:02:59.324 --> 01:03:02.793
No! Superman
is mine to destroy!

01:03:02.795 --> 01:03:04.894
We disagree.

01:03:04.896 --> 01:03:06.829
Open the gates!

01:03:06.831 --> 01:03:09.865
Prepare for my arrival.

01:03:21.146 --> 01:03:23.646
No!

01:03:42.333 --> 01:03:43.802
What the hell?

01:04:38.789 --> 01:04:41.657
For Apokolips!

01:04:50.835 --> 01:04:53.739
No! Not yet! Not now!

01:04:54.373 --> 01:04:55.708
My god!

01:05:00.612 --> 01:05:02.414
I thought Superman was yours.

01:05:04.682 --> 01:05:07.249
You just gonna
hand him to Darkseid?

01:05:07.251 --> 01:05:09.387
Wow.

01:06:04.577 --> 01:06:05.874
What?

01:06:05.876 --> 01:06:07.844
Henshaw!

01:06:12.684 --> 01:06:13.916
No!

01:06:13.918 --> 01:06:15.753
No!

01:06:21.693 --> 01:06:24.427
Now that they've been
cut-off from Darkseid,

01:06:24.429 --> 01:06:27.229
the Cyborg Corps
is mind to control.

01:06:27.231 --> 01:06:28.632
And I've just ordered them

01:06:28.634 --> 01:06:31.704
to destroy Superman's
precious Metropolis.

01:06:42.780 --> 01:06:43.983
Ah, come on!

01:06:46.885 --> 01:06:49.021

01:07:03.800 --> 01:07:06.769
I've sacrificed
everything now

01:07:06.771 --> 01:07:08.737
just to kill him.

01:07:08.739 --> 01:07:11.173
But not before
I've made him watch

01:07:11.175 --> 01:07:13.846

your biggest problem.

It isn't too late.
There's always a way out.

How about for my wife?

01:09:42.293 --> 01:09:43.929
Was there a way out for her?

01:10:03.414 --> 01:10:05.348
Is this what Terri would want?

01:10:05.350 --> 01:10:06.885
Don't say her name!

You're not allowed
to say her name.

She was always
apprehensive in space.

She tried to hide it,
but I knew.

I told her she'd be okay.

01:10:26.805 --> 01:10:29.007
We all would.
We had Superman.

01:10:31.208 --> 01:10:33.009
Until we didn't.

01:10:33.011 --> 01:10:35.911
Until my ship and
my crew were debris.

weren't even dead, yet!

All you hear today

01:11:23.360 --> 01:11:26.631
is, "How do we live in
a world without Superman?"

01:11:27.798 --> 01:11:30.266
Well, some of us
already had to.

01:11:30.268 --> 01:11:31.933
Some of us watched

01:11:31.935 --> 01:11:33.335
as everything we had,

01:11:33.337 --> 01:11:36.272
everything we loved, was lost.

01:11:36.274 --> 01:11:37.809
Oh, give it a rest!

Huh?

01:11:39.944 --> 01:11:42.179
This isn't about
your wife and you know it.

01:11:42.814 --> 01:11:44.880
It's about you.

You let Darkseid
turn you into this.

01:11:47.618 --> 01:11:50.219
Superman turned me into this.

01:11:50.221 --> 01:11:54.123
Darkseid only rebuilt me and taught me
how to wield my hatred as a weapon.

01:11:54.125 --> 01:11:57.326
- Just like he'd done with...
- Doomsday,

01:11:57.328 --> 01:12:00.295
That beast was only
a mindless assassin.

a singular purpose.

01:12:03.201 --> 01:12:06.268

remains of Superman.

I could hope for.

01:21:33.703 --> 01:21:35.870
Six months
and 400 miles later,

01:21:35.872 --> 01:21:39.075
a happy return for
one of the <i>Daily Planet's</i> own.

01:21:39.077 --> 01:21:40.342
Clark Kent,

01:21:40.344 --> 01:21:41.910
feared lost
in the Doomsday fight,

01:21:41.912 --> 01:21:43.210
is back home tonight.

01:21:43.212 --> 01:21:44.513
Thanks to the keen eye

01:21:44.515 --> 01:21:46.281
of another Metropolis citizen

01:21:46.283 --> 01:21:47.715
we thought we'd lost.

01:21:47.717 --> 01:21:52.086
I recognized Mr. Kent
from his byline photo

01:21:52.088 --> 01:21:53.725
<i>and brought him home.</i>

01:21:56.226 --> 01:21:58.760
Martian Manhunter
sounds nothing like me.

01:21:58.762 --> 01:22:00.731
Oh, everybody says that.

01:22:02.865 --> 01:22:04.432
Hey, I almost forgot.

01:22:04.434 --> 01:22:05.866
Conner's all settled.

01:22:05.868 --> 01:22:09.273
He said, "Thanks for
the sweater, babe."

01:22:09.974 --> 01:22:11.907
Aw!

01:22:11.909 --> 01:22:14.442
They're gonna eat him alive.

01:22:14.444 --> 01:22:17.012
So, where did we leave off?

01:22:19.650 --> 01:22:20.750
Yeah?

01:22:20.752 --> 01:22:22.287
You're late.

01:22:22.920 --> 01:22:25.019
Right.

01:22:25.021 --> 01:22:26.420
Be there in a sec.

01:22:26.422 --> 01:22:28.826
Oh, tell Lois
I'll see her Friday.

01:22:30.728 --> 01:22:31.962
Friday?

01:22:33.264 --> 01:22:34.830
What is it?

01:22:34.832 --> 01:22:37.065
Worlds colliding.

01:22:37.067 --> 01:22:38.569
Also, I have to go.

01:22:39.470 --> 01:22:41.639
It's okay. I understand.

01:22:44.475 --> 01:22:45.843
I'll wait up.

01:26:33.804 --> 01:26:35.603
Henshaw may be gone,

01:26:35.605 --> 01:26:37.638
but this was
still the boldest move

01:26:37.640 --> 01:26:40.576
we've seen
from Apokolips, yet.

01:26:40.578 --> 01:26:42.843
Darkseid
won't stay down for long

01:26:42.845 --> 01:26:45.112
and we can't
play defense forever.

01:26:45.114 --> 01:26:46.548
Then we agree.

01:26:46.550 --> 01:26:48.683
We're going to have to take
this fight to his doorstep.

01:26:48.685 --> 01:26:50.153
Excellent.

01:26:52.323 --> 01:26:53.658
Count me in,

01:26:54.559 --> 01:26:55.760
team.

01:26:58.162 --> 01:27:00.465
Okay, who left
the front door open?

01:27:02.456 --> 01:27:07.456
