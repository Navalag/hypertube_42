00:01:27.588 --> 00:01:28.839
Last November,

00:01:29.089 --> 00:01:32.161
Hong Kong experienced
the latest typhoon arrival ever in a year.

00:01:32.708 --> 00:01:33.550
Typhoon Coral

00:01:33.760 --> 00:01:36.362
brought over 200mm of
rainfall to Hong Kong.

00:03:16.613 --> 00:03:17.738
Man... Wake up,

00:03:17.863 --> 00:03:18.654
Man... Thieves.

00:03:20.154 --> 00:03:22.362
Wake up, Man. Thieves.

00:03:22.487 --> 00:03:23.195
Shut up!

00:04:01.234 --> 00:04:02.234
Answer your phone.

00:04:09.733 --> 00:04:10.733
Van 71 calling.

00:04:11.233 --> 00:04:11.983
Van 71.

00:04:12.441 --> 00:04:13.899
Container Port Road South in Kwai Chung,

00:04:14.024 --> 00:04:16.483
near street light CC0381.

00:04:16.608 --> 00:04:18.448
There's a TADO (Traffic
Accident Damage Only).

00:04:18.523 --> 00:04:21.232
Someone's hurt, looks conscious.
Wait for more detail.

00:04:21.523 --> 00:04:22.324
Mister, you're hurt.

00:04:22.398 --> 00:04:23.023
Do you need an ambulance?

00:04:23.148 --> 00:04:25.482
You shut up! I can't understand
Chinese. Piss off!

00:04:25.565 --> 00:04:26.565
Get the fuck out of here man!

00:04:26.690 --> 00:04:27.689
You are suspected of dangerous
and drunk driving.

00:04:27.772 --> 00:04:28.564
Don't touch me, don't touch me.

00:04:28.647 --> 00:04:30.731
Shut up. Don't fucking touch me!
All right.

00:04:30.856 --> 00:04:32.564
Hey, watch your tongue.
Quit the foul language.

00:04:32.689 --> 00:04:33.529
Show me your ID card.

00:04:33.606 --> 00:04:35.147
What ID card? No!

00:04:35.314 --> 00:04:36.731
Do I need to carry an ID card?

00:04:36.856 --> 00:04:37.397
If you don't show us,

00:04:37.481 --> 00:04:38.064
we'll take you to the
police station right now.

00:04:38.189 --> 00:04:39.309
Do you know who my uncle is?

00:04:41.146 --> 00:04:41.480
Sit down!

00:04:41.605 --> 00:04:42.188
Shut up.

00:04:42.896 --> 00:04:43.813
Calm down.

00:04:43.980 --> 00:04:44.646
Sit still there.

00:04:44.855 --> 00:04:48.063
Hello? Yeah! Uncle! Yeah, this is Brian.

00:04:48.271 --> 00:04:50.190
These dumb-ass police won't
let me go right now.

00:04:50.770 --> 00:04:55.062
All right! You! Take the phone!

00:04:57.437 --> 00:05:01.478
Hello? This is Emergency Unit
commander M.Y. Shum.

00:05:01.686 --> 00:05:02.966
He's suspected of drunk driving.

00:05:03.603 --> 00:05:04.843
What's his relationship to you?

00:05:11.768 --> 00:05:14.102
Uncle, yeah! Can I go now?

00:05:14.227 --> 00:05:17.310
Hello? A man crashed his car
and was suspected of drunk driving.

00:05:17.935 --> 00:05:19.477
He said his uncle is a judge.

00:05:19.602 --> 00:05:20.018
What? They're mad dogs.

00:05:20.143 --> 00:05:20.685
I must go.

00:05:21.518 --> 00:05:24.809
I... have to go. Hello?

00:05:26.392 --> 00:05:27.184
Arrest him!

00:05:42.683 --> 00:05:43.641
Joe

00:05:50.640 --> 00:05:53.349
We're cops, not mad dogs.

00:05:53.765 --> 00:05:56.806
If you assault cops, I
could beat you to death!

00:06:06.597 --> 00:06:08.277
Vincent, these are the documents you want.

00:06:08.347 --> 00:06:09.055
Thank you.

00:06:16.971 --> 00:06:20.387
Lau, Commissioner Tsang's flight
just arrived in Copenhagen.

00:06:20.804 --> 00:06:21.887
His mobile is still off.

00:06:22.471 --> 00:06:24.262
Headquarters Command Control Centre said,

00:06:24.387 --> 00:06:25.346
apart from the Police
Public Relations Branch

00:06:25.721 --> 00:06:26.637
and Headquarters Command Control Centre,

00:06:26.762 --> 00:06:28.095
at least three G4 tactical teams

00:06:28.220 --> 00:06:29.345
took action 15 minutes ago.

00:06:29.928 --> 00:06:30.720
Is it that serious?

00:06:30.845 --> 00:06:32.470
There's more.

00:06:32.803 --> 00:06:35.261
Twenty minutes ago, Deputy Police
Commissioner Lee as Acting Commissioner

00:06:35.428 --> 00:06:37.261
announced a Tier One Response.

00:06:42.469 --> 00:06:43.135
Something's up.

00:06:54.551 --> 00:06:55.801
Sir

00:06:56.259 --> 00:06:56.884
Lau.

00:06:57.259 --> 00:07:00.009
The big show tonight is obviously
against you. Watch out.

00:07:11.924 --> 00:07:13.466
Save the formality. Time is short.

00:07:13.757 --> 00:07:14.799
Albert, let's start.

00:07:15.091 --> 00:07:17.716
We called you all back so late

00:07:18.174 --> 00:07:19.549
because of two things.

00:07:20.049 --> 00:07:22.132
First, an hour and a half ago,

00:07:22.881 --> 00:07:25.201
an explosive went off outside
the Broadway Mong Kok cinema.

00:07:25.506 --> 00:07:27.107
So far no casualties have been reported.

00:07:27.631 --> 00:07:29.673
Second, last night at 23:00,

00:07:29.798 --> 00:07:31.131
an Emergency Unit van in
New Territories South

00:07:31.256 --> 00:07:33.505
hadn't reported to the Command Centre
for 30 minutes.

00:07:33.797 --> 00:07:34.797
At 23:19,

00:07:35.005 --> 00:07:37.505
our report room received
an anonymous phone call.

00:07:37.964 --> 00:07:38.672
Leanne

00:07:39.297 --> 00:07:41.547
An Emergency Unit van, with five cops,

00:07:41.672 --> 00:07:44.421
and all the equipment in the van.
What's it all worth?

00:07:45.338 --> 00:07:46.171
Michael

00:07:47.463 --> 00:07:48.588
The Emergency Unit
control centre confirmed that

00:07:48.838 --> 00:07:51.546
No. NTS 71 is still out of contact.

00:07:52.338 --> 00:07:55.753
Regional Command records show
No. 71 was mid-shift.

00:07:55.878 --> 00:07:58.545
At 22:44, it had just dealt
with a drunkard causing trouble.

00:07:58.712 --> 00:08:00.672
They continued on with work
and then went missing.

00:08:00.837 --> 00:08:02.170
Not only the EU van,

00:08:02.795 --> 00:08:04.962
but also the phones
of the five officers went dead.

00:08:05.795 --> 00:08:07.961
We all know GPS isn't exact.

00:08:08.919 --> 00:08:10.127
Besides radio records,

00:08:10.627 --> 00:08:11.669
we activated the Major
Incident Investigation

00:08:11.752 --> 00:08:13.336
and Disaster Support System

00:08:13.961 --> 00:08:15.877
and locked down a 20km radius.

00:08:16.586 --> 00:08:19.425
New Territories South sent out two EU vans
and patrol cars to follow up.

00:08:19.460 --> 00:08:20.335
Up to now...

00:08:21.710 --> 00:08:24.335
Lau. Up to this point, what do you think?

00:08:28.209 --> 00:08:29.417
Michael's deployment is right.

00:08:29.792 --> 00:08:31.542
But I'd call in everyone

00:08:31.667 --> 00:08:32.875
related to cases

00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:34.542
handled earlier by No.71

00:08:34.750 --> 00:08:36.042
to assist in our investigation.

00:08:36.167 --> 00:08:38.042
We've already done what you've just said.

00:08:40.708 --> 00:08:42.999
Listen, on the face of it,

00:08:43.124 --> 00:08:45.666
the Mong Kok bomb and the hijacked van

00:08:45.916 --> 00:08:47.416
can't be random incidents

00:08:48.208 --> 00:08:49.748
as they happened around the same time.

00:08:50.123 --> 00:08:51.040
23 minutes ago,

00:08:51.165 --> 00:08:52.832
I activated the Emergency Response System

00:08:53.165 --> 00:08:55.373
and this is the Provisional
Command Centre.

00:08:55.623 --> 00:08:57.998
To, you're the Director of IT.

00:08:58.248 --> 00:08:59.165
I want you to explain

00:08:59.415 --> 00:09:00.789
why this happened.

00:09:04.122 --> 00:09:07.122
Lee, as the Supervisory Board
and computer section heads aren't here,

00:09:07.622 --> 00:09:08.456
let me answer for...

00:09:08.581 --> 00:09:10.122
I'm asking about the technical stuff.

00:09:10.331 --> 00:09:11.455
Can you give an answer?

00:09:13.163 --> 00:09:14.038
To!

00:09:15.413 --> 00:09:16.974
Given today's technology and resources,

00:09:17.330 --> 00:09:19.246
the hijackers can only block a channel.

00:09:19.746 --> 00:09:20.788
Beyond our department,

00:09:20.955 --> 00:09:23.037
no one knows what frequency we use.

00:09:23.579 --> 00:09:25.780
It's simple. We'll check with
the Broadcasting Authority

00:09:25.829 --> 00:09:27.954
to see where TV and radio signals
in New Territories South

00:09:28.037 --> 00:09:29.120
had interference.

00:09:29.245 --> 00:09:31.412
We can then locate
where the hijacking took place.

00:09:31.537 --> 00:09:32.829
Our budget was cut,

00:09:33.120 --> 00:09:34.578
and $540 million was spent

00:09:34.744 --> 00:09:35.619
over six years for

00:09:35.869 --> 00:09:37.389
so-called state-of-the-art technology.

00:09:39.036 --> 00:09:40.453
The Commissioner is in
Copenhagen right now

00:09:40.619 --> 00:09:42.099
boasting about how safe Hong Kong is,

00:09:42.411 --> 00:09:43.651
how professional the police is.

00:09:43.786 --> 00:09:45.202
How could we imagine
this ridiculous system

00:09:45.327 --> 00:09:47.702
would let a whole team and

00:09:47.785 --> 00:09:49.225
a police van vanish without a trace?

00:09:49.702 --> 00:09:51.368
I could draw conclusions now.

00:09:51.702 --> 00:09:53.035
Two possibilities.

00:09:53.285 --> 00:09:55.201
First, there's a mole in the force.

00:09:55.576 --> 00:09:58.951
Second, there's a serious loophole
in our communications system.

00:09:59.159 --> 00:10:01.326
It's your department's responsibility, To.

00:10:02.201 --> 00:10:03.534
Albert, carry on.

00:10:03.701 --> 00:10:04.867
According to the armoury's records,

00:10:05.034 --> 00:10:07.783
Van No.71 was fully loaded.

00:10:08.200 --> 00:10:09.321
Five officers were on board.

00:10:09.658 --> 00:10:11.533
Driver Johnny Wong, 6911,

00:10:11.825 --> 00:10:14.033
plainclothes detective
Kelvin Chang, 60625,

00:10:14.200 --> 00:10:16.283
Sergeant M.Y. Shum, 48475,

00:10:16.450 --> 00:10:19.032
Communicator C.M. Leung, 38543

00:10:19.449 --> 00:10:24.782
and Joe Lee, 78633,
sitting in the rear seat.

00:10:27.615 --> 00:10:29.781
I'm treating this as a terrorist incident.

00:10:30.406 --> 00:10:34.073
Considering its gravity,
I've decided to take charge.

00:10:34.281 --> 00:10:36.656
The operation code is Cold War.

00:10:39.322 --> 00:10:41.780
Listen up, taking police officers hostage

00:10:41.863 --> 00:10:43.697
is never tolerated in Hong Kong.

00:10:43.947 --> 00:10:44.947
Never!

00:10:45.988 --> 00:10:48.780
Lau, my team is ready.

00:10:57.737 --> 00:10:58.897
You have to watch To closely.

00:11:05.653 --> 00:11:07.236
To make an EU van disappear,

00:11:08.236 --> 00:11:09.986
you'd not just block the GPS in the van

00:11:10.153 --> 00:11:11.694
and cut all uploads and downloads,

00:11:12.402 --> 00:11:13.402
but also kill its radio.

00:11:14.485 --> 00:11:16.860
80% of Hong Kong's highways
are equipped with cameras.

00:11:17.194 --> 00:11:18.834
Even if they all fail, it doesn't matter.

00:11:20.527 --> 00:11:24.609
What's best about the third-generation
communication system is this:

00:11:25.234 --> 00:11:27.151
every officer's radio has GPS.

00:11:27.401 --> 00:11:30.443
Even if it's turned off,
we can switch it on via central computer.

00:11:32.859 --> 00:11:33.979
How come I didn't know that?

00:11:34.025 --> 00:11:35.192
It's the Cat. 2 setup.

00:11:35.733 --> 00:11:37.733
Not even
the legislature's Finance Committee knows.

00:11:38.400 --> 00:11:41.692
You're an admin executive,
so of course you wouldn't know.

00:11:42.525 --> 00:11:43.125
In other words,

00:11:43.150 --> 00:11:44.941
every policeman is wearing a bug?

00:11:45.649 --> 00:11:48.566
Not a bug - a secret weapon!

00:11:53.649 --> 00:11:56.106
Listen! The data shows
the abducted officers

00:11:56.231 --> 00:11:58.815
are being held at the shipyard on
Tam Kon Shan Road in Tsing Yi.

00:11:59.356 --> 00:12:01.065
Until now, our EU van

00:12:01.356 --> 00:12:03.273
and its weapons are still missing.

00:12:03.606 --> 00:12:04.648
We have to speed up.

00:12:11.439 --> 00:12:14.605
Because of his son,
Lee has made this whole deployment mess.

00:12:14.647 --> 00:12:15.230
Hmm.

00:12:15.605 --> 00:12:18.164
Time is so tight and Criminal
Intelligence Bureau isn't involved.

00:12:19.146 --> 00:12:20.771
Our men will be put in danger.

00:12:21.688 --> 00:12:22.104
Hmm.

00:12:22.188 --> 00:12:22.813
Lau.

00:12:23.771 --> 00:12:26.271
Do you think there's a mole in the force?

00:12:26.813 --> 00:12:27.479
No, I don't.

00:12:31.478 --> 00:12:33.878
Maybe there's something wrong
with our communications system.

00:12:36.437 --> 00:12:38.187
What's wrong is the operation code name.

00:13:06.517 --> 00:13:07.017
Lau.

00:13:15.224 --> 00:13:15.849
Lee.

00:13:15.974 --> 00:13:17.454
You can get ready to open the window.

00:13:23.473 --> 00:13:25.598
Lee, can we talk a while?

00:13:37.431 --> 00:13:39.032
I understand Joe is on the hostage list.

00:13:39.097 --> 00:13:40.857
But should you let Albert
take charge of it?

00:13:42.639 --> 00:13:43.764
I just saw the floor plans

00:13:44.305 --> 00:13:45.763
they're using are three years old

00:13:45.805 --> 00:13:46.680
and don't have Building Department's chop.

00:13:47.221 --> 00:13:48.661
Since the position has been located,

00:13:48.888 --> 00:13:51.008
shouldn't we plan everything first
before storming in?

00:13:52.263 --> 00:13:54.064
Don't go any further.
It's dangerous outside.

00:13:55.096 --> 00:13:55.896
Albert

00:14:03.387 --> 00:14:04.095
Don't worry.

00:14:14.344 --> 00:14:16.219
Fellows, this is M.B. Lee speaking.

00:14:16.469 --> 00:14:17.427
Listen to my orders.

00:14:23.468 --> 00:14:24.135
Go.

00:14:42.341 --> 00:14:42.841
(In Urdu) I'm fine. How are you there?

00:14:42.925 --> 00:14:44.841
Hey! Put the phone down.

00:14:45.008 --> 00:14:47.925
Who are you? What are you here for?

00:14:48.758 --> 00:14:49.924
Put the phone down now!

00:14:50.382 --> 00:14:52.007
Cops! Get up!

00:14:53.507 --> 00:14:54.757
Put it down! Or I'll fucking shoot you.

00:14:54.924 --> 00:14:56.299
- Put down your gun.
- Target Lock, Target Lock

00:14:56.424 --> 00:14:56.965
Fire!

00:15:16.713 --> 00:15:17.297
Freeze!

00:15:19.338 --> 00:15:20.672
Stand still. Don't move.

00:15:22.088 --> 00:15:23.088
Don't move.

00:15:23.421 --> 00:15:24.671
Police! Don't move.

00:15:52.460 --> 00:15:54.335
Team C, insert the optical fibres now.

00:16:03.584 --> 00:16:05.664
Team C, approaching
the hostages' suspected location.

00:16:16.125 --> 00:16:18.999
Sir, we've found lots of mannequins
with radios and bombs.

00:16:23.666 --> 00:16:26.999
I'm very confident that

00:16:27.249 --> 00:16:30.123
Hong Kong remains the safest Asian city.

00:16:30.206 --> 00:16:31.206
This reputation...

00:17:05.412 --> 00:17:06.162
Sir.

00:17:06.537 --> 00:17:07.370
Open the door

00:17:07.620 --> 00:17:08.495
Sorry sir.

00:17:09.995 --> 00:17:10.912
Open the door.

00:17:11.078 --> 00:17:13.369
We're afraid we can't, sir.

00:17:14.911 --> 00:17:17.744
If Albert is with Lee, tell Albert that

00:17:17.994 --> 00:17:18.994
I want to see him.

00:17:38.075 --> 00:17:42.159
Tier One Response! How dare he?

00:17:46.991 --> 00:17:48.283
What can I help you with?

00:17:53.491 --> 00:17:54.366
I befieve

00:17:55.365 --> 00:17:58.990
intelligence is key to a
successful operation.

00:17:59.865 --> 00:18:01.698
If you can't read any information

00:18:01.782 --> 00:18:03.740
because of your rank, just let me know.

00:18:07.406 --> 00:18:09.364
I suspect this hijacking case

00:18:10.822 --> 00:18:12.502
is somehow linked to M.B. Lee and his son.

00:18:17.363 --> 00:18:20.004
I want to see Lee's conduct report
at the executive council meeting

00:18:20.696 --> 00:18:22.030
and his background check.

00:18:27.071 --> 00:18:28.154
I'll send you a copy

00:18:28.404 --> 00:18:29.404
in an hour.

00:18:29.779 --> 00:18:30.862
Thank you. Mr Luk.

00:18:35.820 --> 00:18:37.320
Trust your own judgment.

00:18:38.529 --> 00:18:41.444
Extreme times require extreme measures.

00:18:42.236 --> 00:18:43.319
I understand.

00:18:55.277 --> 00:18:57.652
(To: Commissioner of Police)

00:19:13.983 --> 00:19:14.608
Come in.

00:19:16.900 --> 00:19:18.200
Looking for me?

00:19:18.275 --> 00:19:18.816
Come in.

00:19:26.065 --> 00:19:26.690
Coffee.

00:19:26.940 --> 00:19:27.565
Thank you.

00:19:28.399 --> 00:19:29.149
Sit down.

00:19:37.523 --> 00:19:39.243
Did you get any leads
from the questioning?

00:19:41.314 --> 00:19:43.034
I passed by the room
but wasn't allowed in,

00:19:43.273 --> 00:19:44.855
even at my rank.

00:19:45.897 --> 00:19:47.605
Those South Asians were just being used.

00:19:50.480 --> 00:19:51.647
Secretary Luk just came by.

00:19:53.272 --> 00:19:54.605
You should have run into him

00:19:54.855 --> 00:19:56.374
if the interrogation finished earlier.

00:20:08.145 --> 00:20:09.228
Cut to the chase.

00:20:10.645 --> 00:20:12.311
I understand how Lee feels.

00:20:13.645 --> 00:20:15.645
But we're the top management
of disciplined forces.

00:20:15.978 --> 00:20:17.394
His role as a father
can't override his role as a policeman

00:20:17.852 --> 00:20:20.852
when he makes decisions.

00:20:24.519 --> 00:20:26.199
I know Secretary Luk thinks highly of you.

00:20:28.268 --> 00:20:29.726
He must have made a deal with you.

00:20:31.476 --> 00:20:32.184
Yes, he did.

00:20:32.768 --> 00:20:33.768
Can you tell me about it?

00:20:36.434 --> 00:20:37.601
Just not now.

00:20:40.433 --> 00:20:41.100
OK.

00:20:43.850 --> 00:20:45.433
What you've just said,

00:20:45.850 --> 00:20:47.225
I can't pass it on for you.

00:20:47.767 --> 00:20:49.642
Please tell my boss directly.

00:20:52.807 --> 00:20:53.847
Just disregard this visit.

00:20:59.641 --> 00:21:00.931
In fact, I prefer latte.

00:21:11.515 --> 00:21:13.472
An Emergency Unit van, with five cops

00:21:13.722 --> 00:21:15.043
and all the equipment in the van.

00:21:15.805 --> 00:21:16.680
What's it all worth?

00:21:18.847 --> 00:21:22.014
I'll contact you again before 3 pm today.

00:21:22.180 --> 00:21:24.429
Ignore him. Don't save us. Don't!

00:21:33.513 --> 00:21:34.912
Has the Commissioner been informed?

00:21:36.553 --> 00:21:38.637
Have you checked the file's properties?

00:21:38.762 --> 00:21:39.387
We tried.

00:21:40.053 --> 00:21:41.678
But they've been overwritten.

00:21:44.303 --> 00:21:46.927
It's almost 9.
We'd normally issue a press release now.

00:21:47.844 --> 00:21:49.552
Lau, if I were you

00:21:49.677 --> 00:21:51.427
I'd tell Lee about this video right away.

00:21:54.761 --> 00:21:57.135
Lau, 20 minutes ago

00:21:57.426 --> 00:21:59.826
a hijacker called 999 once
with an unregistered mobile phone.

00:22:00.718 --> 00:22:02.398
He asked if we'd finished the calculation.

00:22:02.551 --> 00:22:04.551
I've set up another system
in the conference room

00:22:04.843 --> 00:22:05.843
to help your work.

00:22:07.050 --> 00:22:08.384
A video from the hijacker.

00:22:09.759 --> 00:22:10.342
Yes,

00:22:10.425 --> 00:22:12.967
call IT and forensics
to the Commissioner's room.

00:22:13.675 --> 00:22:14.467
Now!

00:22:14.884 --> 00:22:16.675
An Emergency Unit van, with five cops,

00:22:17.009 --> 00:22:18.329
and all the equipment in the van.

00:22:19.091 --> 00:22:19.892
What's it all worth?

00:22:21.674 --> 00:22:24.466
I'll contact you again before 3 pm today.

00:22:24.591 --> 00:22:26.841
Ignore him. Don't save us. Don't!

00:22:27.174 --> 00:22:27.758
Lau.

00:22:27.841 --> 00:22:29.840
The total sum based
on your estimate is on the last page.

00:22:29.965 --> 00:22:31.340
The riddle is about an EU van,

00:22:31.548 --> 00:22:33.340
five cops and all the equipment.

00:22:34.132 --> 00:22:35.465
It's easy to calculate.

00:22:35.840 --> 00:22:37.382
Probably not more than $45 million.

00:22:38.673 --> 00:22:41.214
No, it can't be that simple.

00:22:41.422 --> 00:22:42.743
There must be something left out.

00:22:43.006 --> 00:22:44.766
When it comes to money,
everyone wants more.

00:22:45.006 --> 00:22:48.131
If this is the answer,
they underrate us too much.

00:22:48.381 --> 00:22:50.796
Who are these people?
Daring to pull such a big stunt?

00:22:52.046 --> 00:22:53.407
The former Commissioner taught me,

00:22:53.630 --> 00:22:56.963
the biggest enemy of the Police Force
is always from inside.

00:22:57.796 --> 00:22:59.880
Vincent, I want a list of

00:23:00.088 --> 00:23:01.670
all dismissed staff since the handover.

00:23:02.170 --> 00:23:03.837
I can think of no more than five people

00:23:03.920 --> 00:23:05.795
capable to taking down
the Hong Kong police.

00:23:06.545 --> 00:23:10.337
What a coincidence. Part of puzzle
is the five cops being held.

00:23:14.711 --> 00:23:17.169
May, call the Administration Bureau.

00:23:17.294 --> 00:23:19.495
Find out the death compensation
for an officer's family.

00:23:39.959 --> 00:23:42.084
Five policemen. Why could it cost so much?

00:23:42.376 --> 00:23:44.042
Preparing for the worst.

00:23:44.916 --> 00:23:46.458
It's assuming all five of them die.

00:23:54.375 --> 00:23:56.832
Lau, the man has been confirmed.

00:23:57.040 --> 00:23:59.241
He's the driver, Johnny Wong.
The hijackers are animals!

00:23:59.374 --> 00:24:00.040
How is he?

00:24:01.040 --> 00:24:02.874
He was found unconscious.

00:24:03.374 --> 00:24:05.415
Accident and Emergency
suspected a heart attack.

00:24:05.874 --> 00:24:07.789
CCTV captured the van dropping him off.

00:24:08.248 --> 00:24:10.049
The van's plates have
been confirmed as fake.

00:24:12.831 --> 00:24:15.039
They're obviously testing our limits,

00:24:15.873 --> 00:24:16.956
especially Lee's.

00:24:17.830 --> 00:24:18.580
Attention.

00:24:19.538 --> 00:24:21.705
It's been more than 10 hours

00:24:22.622 --> 00:24:24.747
since our EU van disappeared last night.

00:24:25.872 --> 00:24:29.746
Not long ago, the hijackers
left a seriously wounded officer

00:24:30.454 --> 00:24:32.295
at a hospital Accident
and Emergency entrance.

00:24:32.871 --> 00:24:36.829
This action is seriously
provoking the Police Force.

00:24:37.371 --> 00:24:39.162
I'll inform the Security Bureau later

00:24:39.536 --> 00:24:41.203
and sign the executive directive.

00:24:41.661 --> 00:24:44.495
Due to the increasing gravity of the case

00:24:44.911 --> 00:24:48.703
I'm now activating Tier Two Response.

00:24:49.078 --> 00:24:50.237
All districts' morning duties

00:24:50.369 --> 00:24:52.910
will be extended for two hours.

00:24:53.327 --> 00:24:55.827
All front-line staff
must cancel their leave.

00:24:56.785 --> 00:25:00.494
Inform the Marine Police,
the airport and public transport.

00:25:00.827 --> 00:25:02.576
I need two-thirds of the Police Force

00:25:02.701 --> 00:25:04.784
in the rescue operation.

00:25:12.450 --> 00:25:13.533
I want to dismiss Lee from duty.

00:25:13.658 --> 00:25:14.492
Impossible.

00:25:14.908 --> 00:25:15.658
Why?

00:25:15.908 --> 00:25:18.492
If you want to take over from Lee,
according to the structure,

00:25:19.283 --> 00:25:21.163
you need to dismiss him
as Acting Commissioner.

00:25:21.742 --> 00:25:25.616
You need to prove dereliction of duty
or his inability to handle duties

00:25:25.699 --> 00:25:26.782
due to health reasons.

00:25:27.241 --> 00:25:30.157
And the whole procedure
takes about two weeks.

00:25:30.282 --> 00:25:34.198
Right. That's the normal procedure,
but not now.

00:25:35.531 --> 00:25:37.406
Don't you remember what
you told me last night

00:25:37.865 --> 00:25:38.865
when I came back to headquarters?

00:25:39.031 --> 00:25:41.656
Lee activated Tier One
Response 20 minutes ago

00:25:41.823 --> 00:25:43.781
in his capacity as Acting Commissioner.

00:25:43.906 --> 00:25:44.989
Since last night,

00:25:45.280 --> 00:25:47.239
as head of the Police Force,

00:25:47.405 --> 00:25:48.645
Lee announced Tier One Response

00:25:48.822 --> 00:25:51.405
without consulting management.

00:25:52.864 --> 00:25:54.239
He did it simply to

00:25:54.364 --> 00:25:55.654
deploy the force easily.

00:25:56.654 --> 00:26:00.738
He's already done
the most difficult part for us.

00:26:06.570 --> 00:26:08.403
To apply state of emergency laws,

00:26:10.195 --> 00:26:12.903
you need at least five votes
from police officer management.

00:26:13.487 --> 00:26:15.407
Currently, half of the members
are in Copenhagen.

00:26:19.444 --> 00:26:20.569
You don't have five votes.

00:26:24.152 --> 00:26:25.194
Albert

00:26:26.527 --> 00:26:27.444
Albert Kwong?

00:26:28.526 --> 00:26:29.985
He's always been on Lee's side,

00:26:31.318 --> 00:26:34.318
but still, he has the highest
academic qualifications in management

00:26:35.651 --> 00:26:37.901
and will have a PhD in law in six months.

00:26:38.360 --> 00:26:39.525
He understands

00:26:39.859 --> 00:26:41.859
the rule of law better than any of us.

00:26:42.484 --> 00:26:46.192
I just talked to him. He's hesitating.

00:27:07.107 --> 00:27:08.357
Thanks, Albert.

00:27:09.482 --> 00:27:11.802
This time it's solely based
on legal-system considerations.

00:27:11.982 --> 00:27:14.814
If I discover that you have any trick
in this to harm my boss,

00:27:15.981 --> 00:27:17.421
I'll do even worse to you in return.

00:27:20.814 --> 00:27:21.981
I won't let you down.

00:27:23.813 --> 00:27:24.894
When should we take action?

00:27:27.230 --> 00:27:28.021
In three minutes.

00:27:29.063 --> 00:27:29.938
Why?

00:27:30.396 --> 00:27:32.688
Give Lee some time. He's
helping us get votes.

00:27:36.229 --> 00:27:36.937
Morning, Mr Lee.

00:27:37.437 --> 00:27:38.645
Any breaking news I should follow up?

00:27:38.812 --> 00:27:39.854
Take a look at the headlines.

00:27:39.937 --> 00:27:40.437
If there's no problem,

00:27:40.520 --> 00:27:42.395
I'll send you
the Chinese and English versions.

00:27:43.312 --> 00:27:46.603
Article 8b isn't right.
Operation Cold War is still going on.

00:27:47.103 --> 00:27:49.463
I don't want to announce
the emergency status to the public.

00:27:49.894 --> 00:27:50.728
I don't get it.

00:27:51.228 --> 00:27:52.394
I said it clear enough.

00:27:52.519 --> 00:27:53.894
Do you need me to repeat it?

00:27:54.353 --> 00:27:55.935
You just asked me to censor the news.

00:27:56.268 --> 00:27:58.602
Lee. I don't think this is
in the Commissioner's authority.

00:27:59.143 --> 00:28:01.435
Wrong. I know the Police Ordinance
better than you.

00:28:01.768 --> 00:28:03.185
I absolutely have this authority.

00:28:04.435 --> 00:28:06.060
I've served two commissioners before.

00:28:06.185 --> 00:28:08.017
Neither of them ever made

00:28:08.142 --> 00:28:09.226
such a request for our department.

00:28:09.351 --> 00:28:10.976
That's because they didn't know how to.

00:28:12.476 --> 00:28:14.017
Listen to my order now.

00:28:14.142 --> 00:28:15.601
Without my approval,

00:28:15.851 --> 00:28:18.183
don't release articles
8 to 10 to the public.

00:28:18.391 --> 00:28:19.266
Understand?

00:28:24.350 --> 00:28:26.870
The operation is still going on.
I agree to coordinate with you.

00:28:26.933 --> 00:28:29.573
But on the state of emergency,
I can't keep it confidential for you

00:28:29.599 --> 00:28:31.679
because every Hong Kong citizen
has the right to know

00:28:31.765 --> 00:28:33.474
about the safety of where they live.

00:28:34.349 --> 00:28:36.557
If you don't withdraw
your request, I won't go.

00:28:38.057 --> 00:28:40.306
Which is more important?

00:28:40.806 --> 00:28:42.514
The public's right to know
or the safety of police officers?

00:28:42.806 --> 00:28:45.514
News and safety are separate things.

00:28:45.764 --> 00:28:47.644
If you want me to ignore
established procedures

00:28:47.681 --> 00:28:48.931
and follow your order,

00:28:49.223 --> 00:28:51.222
that is rule by an individual,
not rule by law, sir

00:29:01.180 --> 00:29:04.804
Phoenix, are you implying
that I'm abusing my duty?

00:29:06.679 --> 00:29:07.846
I don't mean that.

00:29:07.971 --> 00:29:10.387
Do you know I can suspend
your duty immediately?

00:29:11.762 --> 00:29:12.470
I know.

00:29:12.803 --> 00:29:15.595
The Commissioner and Acting Commissioner
have such an authority.

00:29:17.928 --> 00:29:19.011
What are you here for?

00:29:19.136 --> 00:29:20.616
I want to discuss something with you.

00:29:23.760 --> 00:29:26.427
Call all detectives with inspector rank
or above to come over.

00:29:26.594 --> 00:29:29.052
Have them bring their pistols.
All of them.

00:29:32.260 --> 00:29:33.260
What's it about?

00:29:34.343 --> 00:29:35.051
Lee.

00:29:35.843 --> 00:29:37.093
I think it's too much.

00:29:37.551 --> 00:29:39.843
That's why you call up
so many constables to suppress me!

00:29:40.343 --> 00:29:41.301
I don't mean that.

00:29:41.426 --> 00:29:42.718
"I don't mean that"?

00:29:43.551 --> 00:29:45.008
You two match each other.

00:29:46.008 --> 00:29:47.633
I heard you used to date.

00:29:48.092 --> 00:29:49.883
No wonder you spoke the same way.

00:29:52.925 --> 00:29:53.717
Lee.

00:29:54.842 --> 00:29:56.632
The EU van belongs to
New Territories South.

00:29:57.049 --> 00:29:59.299
Their head should take charge.

00:29:59.924 --> 00:30:00.799
This is headquarters.

00:30:01.632 --> 00:30:02.507
You and I have our duties.

00:30:02.632 --> 00:30:04.392
Since the handover, the
Deputy Commissioners

00:30:04.466 --> 00:30:06.132
and even the Assistant Commissioners
shouldn't be directly involved.

00:30:06.881 --> 00:30:09.590
In other words,
you also think I'm abusing my power?

00:30:10.381 --> 00:30:11.548
I understand how you feel

00:30:12.340 --> 00:30:13.548
but I worry that your emotions
affected your judgment.

00:30:13.631 --> 00:30:14.381
I'm asking you: Yes or no?

00:30:14.465 --> 00:30:15.256
Yes.

00:30:18.505 --> 00:30:19.922
Lee. The case is serious.

00:30:20.047 --> 00:30:22.380
But objectively speaking,
your reaction is over the top.

00:30:32.963 --> 00:30:35.588
Sean Lau. You should know that

00:30:35.713 --> 00:30:37.046
I don't need any reason

00:30:37.713 --> 00:30:39.193
to suspend you from duty immediately.

00:30:39.463 --> 00:30:40.128
I know.

00:30:41.587 --> 00:30:43.628
But I have that power too.

00:30:43.712 --> 00:30:46.420
With what you just said,
plus these few constables,

00:30:46.837 --> 00:30:49.357
it's enough for me to charge
you with insulting your supervisor.

00:30:50.669 --> 00:30:53.252
Albert, go outwith Lau.

00:30:56.752 --> 00:30:57.752
Albert

00:31:00.919 --> 00:31:02.001
Take them away.

00:31:03.626 --> 00:31:04.126
Sorry, Lau

00:31:04.168 --> 00:31:05.043
What are you doing here? Are you crazy?

00:31:05.168 --> 00:31:06.648
Put down your gun. Stand at the back.

00:31:12.542 --> 00:31:14.625
This has never happened
since the handover.

00:31:15.459 --> 00:31:17.084
In other countries,

00:31:17.250 --> 00:31:18.167
it'd be a coup d'état.

00:31:20.417 --> 00:31:21.834
I'm now the Acting Commissioner.

00:31:22.250 --> 00:31:24.458
At 09:06, Sean Lau,

00:31:25.249 --> 00:31:26.666
I officially suspend you from duty.

00:31:30.874 --> 00:31:32.624
Lee, there are rules in the Police Force.

00:31:32.708 --> 00:31:33.624
If a case involves a relative,

00:31:33.708 --> 00:31:34.623
one should make a declaration.

00:31:34.748 --> 00:31:35.498
I'm not commanding the operation

00:31:35.582 --> 00:31:36.290
You obviously failed to do so.

00:31:36.582 --> 00:31:37.143
It proved that

00:31:37.207 --> 00:31:38.582
your judgment was in question.

00:31:38.665 --> 00:31:39.165
It's not a matter of which region
or department.

00:31:39.248 --> 00:31:39.915
I question your ability.

00:31:40.207 --> 00:31:40.665
Fairly speaking

00:31:40.748 --> 00:31:41.790
- you should hand over your power.
- This time the hijackers are exploiting

00:31:41.873 --> 00:31:43.040
This'll be best for everyone.

00:31:43.165 --> 00:31:43.873
Our communication system's loopholes.

00:31:43.998 --> 00:31:44.832
- If you disagree,
- It's a terrorist attack.

00:31:44.915 --> 00:31:45.956
Sorry Deputy Commissioner M.B. Lee.

00:31:46.081 --> 00:31:46.622
Don't form any factions in front of me!

00:31:46.747 --> 00:31:47.622
I'll temporarily halt your duty

00:31:47.747 --> 00:31:48.456
I won't be afraid of you,

00:31:48.539 --> 00:31:49.164
under the Public Interest
and Safety Ordinance.

00:31:49.165 --> 00:31:49.789
even you have Security Bureau support.

00:31:49.872 --> 00:31:50.497
Bullshit.

00:31:51.289 --> 00:31:52.489
Are you trying to seize power?

00:31:53.164 --> 00:31:54.164
Do you have enough votes?

00:31:54.581 --> 00:31:55.164
Sir

00:31:55.289 --> 00:31:56.038
What is it?

00:31:57.955 --> 00:31:59.038
The Commissioner's call.

00:31:59.163 --> 00:32:01.043
He's asking for
the chief commander of Cold War.

00:32:03.996 --> 00:32:05.276
Is this the Commissioner's idea?

00:32:14.954 --> 00:32:15.579
Commissioner Tsang.

00:32:15.662 --> 00:32:18.744
Lau, are you in charge of Cold War now?

00:32:22.119 --> 00:32:22.703
Yes.

00:32:23.411 --> 00:32:24.828
Is Lee around?

00:32:25.869 --> 00:32:26.994
He's right here.

00:32:27.703 --> 00:32:29.993
Vincent and Albert are around too.

00:32:30.868 --> 00:32:31.368
Good.

00:32:31.410 --> 00:32:33.077
I'll take the earliest flight back.

00:32:33.285 --> 00:32:34.118
Lau, M.B.

00:32:34.535 --> 00:32:36.368
don't let the situation get any worse.

00:32:36.702 --> 00:32:38.702
Phoenix, keep in contact.

00:32:39.493 --> 00:32:41.826
Yes sir, thank you sir.

00:33:03.865 --> 00:33:04.574
Attention please.

00:33:05.615 --> 00:33:07.615
Acting Commissioner M.B. Lee
just surrendered power

00:33:07.699 --> 00:33:09.115
in operation Cold War

00:33:09.990 --> 00:33:11.782
for personal and health reasons.

00:33:12.157 --> 00:33:14.437
In accordance with
Police Ordinance Chapter 232 Section 16

00:33:15.198 --> 00:33:17.406
gazette police officers
and at least two deputy commissioners

00:33:17.531 --> 00:33:19.656
have concurred that from now on,

00:33:20.739 --> 00:33:21.698
at 09:12,

00:33:22.823 --> 00:33:25.863
Deputy Commissioner Sean Lau
will be Acting Commissioner

00:33:26.322 --> 00:33:28.905
and chief commander of
operation Cold War. Lau.

00:33:31.822 --> 00:33:35.987
Listen, you should all
know that we are now

00:33:37.362 --> 00:33:39.282
at a disadvantage
in terms of time and situation.

00:33:40.404 --> 00:33:43.237
We have to strike a balance
between maintaining Hong Kong safety

00:33:43.904 --> 00:33:45.486
and rescuing the hostages.

00:33:46.361 --> 00:33:49.528
First, remove all emergency
status warnings.

00:33:50.111 --> 00:33:52.195
All departments, including PTU,

00:33:52.736 --> 00:33:54.611
G4 and SDU,

00:33:55.486 --> 00:33:59.235
should resume normal duties.
We can't let the hijackers know

00:34:00.402 --> 00:34:02.985
we made such a huge
deployment because of them.

00:34:04.069 --> 00:34:06.901
Second, considering this
could be a long fight,

00:34:08.109 --> 00:34:11.234
I now assign Senior Superintendents
Vincent Tsui and Albert Kwong

00:34:11.693 --> 00:34:13.413
as deputy commanders
of operation Cold War.

00:34:13.984 --> 00:34:16.784
Members in the provisional command centre
need to set up a duty roster:

00:34:16.901 --> 00:34:21.025
two shifts for the command centre
and three for other departments,

00:34:21.150 --> 00:34:23.911
to be in force until the case is closed
or Commissioner Tsang returns.

00:34:24.692 --> 00:34:25.567
Get to work!

00:34:32.274 --> 00:34:32.982
Hello?

00:34:33.232 --> 00:34:33.982
Who are you?

00:34:34.857 --> 00:34:36.649
Why is my colleague's
mobile in your hands?

00:34:37.524 --> 00:34:38.982
Who are you?

00:34:39.731 --> 00:34:41.981
My surname is Lau, Sean Lau.

00:34:42.231 --> 00:34:44.671
There are three people in the Police Force
with the same name:

00:34:45.190 --> 00:34:46.773
one in the Marine Police,
one is a constable,

00:34:46.898 --> 00:34:48.699
another is the Deputy
Commissioner of Police.

00:34:48.773 --> 00:34:50.106
I'm the Acting Commissioner.

00:34:50.647 --> 00:34:51.564
I'm asking you

00:34:52.022 --> 00:34:54.105
why our colleague's phone is in your hands

00:34:54.272 --> 00:34:55.605
I called you up.

00:34:55.772 --> 00:34:58.022
Watch your manner when you talk to me.

00:34:58.105 --> 00:34:59.466
How will you release the hostages?

00:34:59.564 --> 00:35:01.643
Don't go to school
if you haven't done your homework.

00:35:01.813 --> 00:35:04.188
Remember, your cops are in my hands!

00:35:04.313 --> 00:35:06.313
And, you're not Sean Lau.

00:35:06.771 --> 00:35:10.146
Tell Sean Lau to answer
my call in three minutes.

00:35:13.353 --> 00:35:14.978
The phone signal started from
Ting Kau Bridge northbound

00:35:15.228 --> 00:35:17.268
towards Castle Peak Road.
Total duration 28 seconds.

00:35:17.520 --> 00:35:18.395
The suspect should be in a vehicle.

00:35:18.687 --> 00:35:20.447
Get video footage from
Transport Department.

00:35:21.103 --> 00:35:22.944
I want his psychoanalysis
and risk assessment.

00:35:22.978 --> 00:35:24.519
What SIM card is he using?
Which mobile phone?

00:35:24.769 --> 00:35:25.890
I want all this immediately.

00:35:25.894 --> 00:35:26.727
Yes sir

00:35:26.977 --> 00:35:28.061
Johnny Wong just died.

00:35:33.227 --> 00:35:35.185
May, inform Phoenix

00:35:36.226 --> 00:35:37.476
and the welfare section.

00:35:37.768 --> 00:35:39.408
Tell them to send people to the hospital.

00:35:39.643 --> 00:35:40.403
How much more time?

00:35:42.143 --> 00:35:43.143
45 seconds.

00:36:11.640 --> 00:36:12.348
Hello?

00:36:13.015 --> 00:36:14.223
Commissioner Lau.

00:36:15.515 --> 00:36:16.395
How should I call you?

00:36:17.098 --> 00:36:19.556
Commissioner, are you well prepared?

00:36:20.222 --> 00:36:21.556
$93.2 million.

00:36:22.056 --> 00:36:23.776
I can only prepare it
in Hong Kong dollars.

00:36:24.389 --> 00:36:25.847
Get it ready before 3:30.

00:36:26.139 --> 00:36:28.306
I'll tell you how to hand it over.

00:36:55.719 --> 00:36:56.511
Albert

00:36:57.178 --> 00:36:57.803
Yes?

00:36:58.053 --> 00:36:59.973
We shouldn't all stay
and use up our energy here.

00:37:00.303 --> 00:37:01.136
You sign off first.

00:37:02.010 --> 00:37:02.843
Lau.

00:37:05.510 --> 00:37:06.718
Let me go to the vault.

00:37:19.717 --> 00:37:22.509
Mr Luk sent this to me.
He wanted me to hand it to you.

00:37:23.009 --> 00:37:24.175
He said you know what it is.

00:37:52.214 --> 00:37:52.881
Mr Tsui,

00:37:56.006 --> 00:37:57.086
I have a few words for you.

00:38:33.710 --> 00:38:34.377
Lau.

00:38:40.126 --> 00:38:40.793
Hello?

00:38:41.376 --> 00:38:43.793
Do you have the cash
with you, Commissioner?

00:38:43.959 --> 00:38:44.668
Yes.

00:38:45.293 --> 00:38:47.376
Let me tell you. Your
calculation is wrong.

00:38:47.501 --> 00:38:48.876
I can't wait any longer. Listen.

00:38:49.043 --> 00:38:52.167
I want $33.33 million in cash.

00:38:52.375 --> 00:38:54.083
You have half an hour to prepare it.

00:38:54.458 --> 00:38:55.698
Also, don't bother to trace me.

00:38:55.833 --> 00:38:57.458
I'm at Chung On Street in Tsuen Wan.

00:39:01.208 --> 00:39:01.791
Hurry.

00:39:11.124 --> 00:39:13.324
After deducting $33 million,
around $60 million remains.

00:39:16.415 --> 00:39:18.373
Lau, just a few words.

00:39:21.956 --> 00:39:24.872
The vault's director reminded me
before I left that

00:39:25.080 --> 00:39:26.580
in case we don't use the whole sum,

00:39:26.914 --> 00:39:28.954
we can return what's unused
to the vault right away.

00:39:28.997 --> 00:39:30.358
He doesn't want to get in trouble.

00:39:32.830 --> 00:39:33.747
Use a dog van.

00:39:38.288 --> 00:39:40.449
Deliver the remaining sum
back to the vault by dog van.

00:39:40.871 --> 00:39:41.621
Be careful.

00:39:55.953 --> 00:39:57.112
What to do with this Lee guy?

00:39:57.577 --> 00:39:59.119
His life is more valuable
than these people together.

00:39:59.327 --> 00:40:00.411
Don't let him die.

00:40:11.201 --> 00:40:12.161
Change the location now.

00:40:20.117 --> 00:40:21.075
The cash is ready.

00:40:21.200 --> 00:40:22.001
How to hand it over?

00:40:22.200 --> 00:40:23.325
Come alone.

00:40:23.575 --> 00:40:24.409
Do you drive?

00:40:24.534 --> 00:40:25.117
Yes, I do.

00:40:34.408 --> 00:40:35.908
CQ, CQ

00:40:35.991 --> 00:40:36.741
Lau,

00:40:44.865 --> 00:40:46.585
I have deployed three
teams to back you up.

00:41:13.320 --> 00:41:14.070
Plate number?

00:41:14.404 --> 00:41:16.195
KM 1605, black

00:41:16.862 --> 00:41:17.654
Where are you now?

00:41:18.195 --> 00:41:19.404
Leaving the car park.

00:41:20.154 --> 00:41:22.737
Go to Arsenal Street,
turn left into Harcourt Road.

00:41:23.112 --> 00:41:25.031
Cross the harbour via
the Western Harbour Tunnel.

00:41:25.611 --> 00:41:28.011
CODY, Car 1 will wait at
the Western Harbour Tunnel entrance.

00:41:31.069 --> 00:41:33.153
Sorry, I've changed my mind.

00:41:33.944 --> 00:41:34.864
Get out of the car now.

00:41:46.484 --> 00:41:50.776
Commissioner, take the escalator
on your left to the footbridge.

00:41:51.776 --> 00:41:53.526
Shall we take a ferry?

00:42:11.232 --> 00:42:12.357
IFC is on Lau's left.

00:42:12.482 --> 00:42:13.440
Four Seasons Hotel in the front.

00:42:13.565 --> 00:42:15.024
Star Ferry Pier on his right.

00:42:19.106 --> 00:42:20.731
Vincent, counting on you now.

00:42:21.148 --> 00:42:23.523
Car 2 and Car 3, go to the Star Ferry.

00:42:24.106 --> 00:42:25.266
Stand by from left and right.

00:42:29.272 --> 00:42:31.480
At your pace, you should almost be there.

00:42:32.438 --> 00:42:34.105
Tell me what's in front of you.

00:42:34.272 --> 00:42:35.480
Pier 7 is in front of me.

00:42:36.313 --> 00:42:38.688
Piers 2 to 6 to outlying
islands on my left.

00:42:45.979 --> 00:42:48.271
Turn left, go to Pier 6.

00:42:48.646 --> 00:42:49.926
Take the ferry to Lantau Island.

00:43:07.352 --> 00:43:08.435
Turn around.

00:43:08.852 --> 00:43:12.310
Take this ferry to Tsim Sha Tsui.

00:43:14.018 --> 00:43:15.018
Run Over.

00:43:16.518 --> 00:43:17.934
Lau turned round, Lau turned round.

00:43:18.018 --> 00:43:18.768
We're all exposed.

00:43:19.643 --> 00:43:20.564
Counter-tailing tactic?

00:43:21.476 --> 00:43:22.726
Let's take the Western Harbour Tunnel.

00:43:22.934 --> 00:43:23.808
Car 1

00:43:23.975 --> 00:43:25.816
Slow down at the Kowloon
exit and wait for me.

00:44:02.639 --> 00:44:05.055
When did you last take a ferry,
Commissioner Lau?

00:44:05.180 --> 00:44:06.101
You keep talking to me.

00:44:07.263 --> 00:44:08.663
Aren't you worried we'll trace you?

00:44:08.971 --> 00:44:11.013
Then I'll call you back in five minutes.

00:44:11.138 --> 00:44:14.679
Before I go, a reminder for you:

00:44:14.971 --> 00:44:18.138
Keep an eye on yourself,
not just the others.

00:44:18.262 --> 00:44:19.845
Your shoelaces have come untied.

00:44:40.426 --> 00:44:42.801
Albert, the phone signal
is very close to Lau's location.

00:44:46.593 --> 00:44:47.993
Team across the harbour on standby.

00:45:01.592 --> 00:45:02.716
Are you Mr Lau?

00:45:02.924 --> 00:45:03.508
Yes.

00:45:09.924 --> 00:45:10.591
Hello?

00:45:10.841 --> 00:45:13.798
Commissioner Lau. Four
minutes behind schedule.

00:45:15.048 --> 00:45:15.757
Get in a taxi

00:45:15.840 --> 00:45:19.423
and go to the airport.
Don't queue for a taxi.

00:45:22.340 --> 00:45:24.547
Mister, my shift is over.
Take another one.

00:45:26.006 --> 00:45:27.422
Police, start the car.

00:45:40.088 --> 00:45:41.255
Received Lau's SMS.

00:45:41.755 --> 00:45:44.255
Taxi plate number Mother Alpha 8714.

00:45:44.630 --> 00:45:47.045
License No. 6618, Leo Hui.

00:45:47.379 --> 00:45:49.962
Hey, wait a while. Coming soon.

00:45:50.254 --> 00:45:51.375
I picked up a difficult one.

00:45:51.379 --> 00:45:51.940
What can I do?

00:45:52.045 --> 00:45:54.629
Set up the mahjong table and wait for me.
Talk later.

00:46:02.961 --> 00:46:03.919
Where are you now?

00:46:05.086 --> 00:46:07.418
Route 5, West Kowloon Corridor.

00:46:08.043 --> 00:46:10.960
Don't go to the airport.
Go up the flyover to Tai Kok Tsui.

00:46:15.335 --> 00:46:17.835
Wait, driver. Turn right,
take the flyover to Tai Kok Tsui.

00:46:17.918 --> 00:46:20.042
First you said the airport
and now its Tai Kok Tsui.

00:46:20.251 --> 00:46:23.751
Sir, Are you having fun?
Can you think clearly first, sir?

00:46:24.542 --> 00:46:28.334
I guess both you
and the money bag are equipped with

00:46:28.459 --> 00:46:29.666
tracking devices, right?

00:46:29.791 --> 00:46:31.071
Have you ever been in the force?

00:46:31.833 --> 00:46:33.916
If you had, you would've
had a bright future.

00:46:34.500 --> 00:46:38.041
I joined in 1988, have we met before?

00:46:38.916 --> 00:46:40.999
I have absolutely no interest in the job.

00:46:41.665 --> 00:46:42.905
How are my colleagues with you?

00:46:44.707 --> 00:46:48.540
Stop! I said stop the car.

00:46:51.456 --> 00:46:52.331
Stop!

00:46:52.456 --> 00:46:54.206
Sir, my license can be revoked!

00:46:54.331 --> 00:46:54.914
Stop!

00:47:01.664 --> 00:47:03.997
Sir, what can I do? We can't stop here.

00:47:07.788 --> 00:47:08.469
What do you want?

00:47:08.705 --> 00:47:09.830
Look down from the bridge.

00:47:14.829 --> 00:47:15.954
You're following me.

00:47:16.412 --> 00:47:18.013
Aren't you concerned about your fellows?

00:47:18.121 --> 00:47:19.996
Don't you want to save them?

00:47:20.579 --> 00:47:24.036
I'll count down from three,
and you'll throw the money down.

00:47:24.953 --> 00:47:27.453
Three, two, one!

00:47:42.410 --> 00:47:43.410
Police! Freeze!

00:47:44.077 --> 00:47:45.035
Put down the money

00:47:52.034 --> 00:47:54.451
Vincent! Come up to help me.

00:48:07.325 --> 00:48:09.074
How about my taxi, sir?

00:48:09.199 --> 00:48:09.782
You just keep silent.

00:48:09.907 --> 00:48:10.616
What should I do?

00:48:12.949 --> 00:48:13.491
Run!

00:49:20.776 --> 00:49:24.734
Ah... My car, Sir! Ah... it hurts!

00:49:37.816 --> 00:49:38.441
Vincent

00:49:45.815 --> 00:49:50.148
Lack of practice. Less nimble.

00:49:55.148 --> 00:49:57.022
Albert, call an ambulance.

00:49:57.314 --> 00:49:58.814
Lau, we've been had.

00:49:59.189 --> 00:50:00.606
The money in the dog van was taken.

00:50:02.189 --> 00:50:03.522
Call an ambulance!

00:50:07.480 --> 00:50:08.438
Vincent

00:50:09.896 --> 00:50:11.813
Find where Lau is. Send the ambulance.

00:50:42.227 --> 00:50:42.893
Yes?

00:50:48.727 --> 00:50:49.310
Sir

00:50:54.809 --> 00:50:55.517
Sorry sir.

00:50:56.559 --> 00:50:57.434
Sorry sir.

00:50:59.851 --> 00:51:02.059
You've worked so hard. Take a rest.

00:51:02.266 --> 00:51:03.016
Thank you sir.

00:51:04.850 --> 00:51:05.516
Lee.

00:51:06.266 --> 00:51:06.975
How is it?

00:51:07.433 --> 00:51:09.873
The Organised Crime team
is taking statements from colleagues.

00:51:10.641 --> 00:51:13.807
Calm the colleagues first.
It's been a tough day for everyone.

00:51:17.599 --> 00:51:18.474
Sir

00:51:23.224 --> 00:51:24.223
Sorry sir.

00:51:27.889 --> 00:51:30.056
Make a statement after
dealing with your wound.

00:51:32.264 --> 00:51:34.681
Take a rest. Where's Lau?

00:51:34.806 --> 00:51:35.388
Over there.

00:51:40.222 --> 00:51:40.972
Vincent?

00:51:44.055 --> 00:51:45.013
Vincent?

00:51:45.804 --> 00:51:47.221
Tell me!

00:51:47.304 --> 00:51:47.846
Mrs Tsui.

00:51:48.221 --> 00:51:48.804
Vincent?

00:51:50.346 --> 00:51:52.346
Where's Vincent?

00:51:52.887 --> 00:51:53.637
Oh...

00:51:55.054 --> 00:51:56.304
Vincent!

00:51:57.011 --> 00:51:57.928
Oh no.

00:51:58.261 --> 00:52:00.261
Bring Vincent to me!

00:52:12.469 --> 00:52:13.260
Lau.

00:52:29.176 --> 00:52:32.092
The Commissioner's flight
is delayed to tomorrow morning.

00:52:33.467 --> 00:52:36.967
Before he got on board,
he only knew there was one commander

00:52:37.092 --> 00:52:39.217
for operation Cold War: you.

00:52:40.466 --> 00:52:43.591
This key, you'd better return it
to him personally tomorrow.

00:52:53.798 --> 00:52:54.673
Sorry.

00:53:00.090 --> 00:53:01.298
Today was so strange!

00:53:02.797 --> 00:53:06.630
Everyone apologised to me once
I arrived in the hospital.

00:53:08.589 --> 00:53:12.297
I can accept their
apologies, but not yours.

00:53:18.504 --> 00:53:20.345
Luckily, the four missing
colleagues are back.

00:53:21.629 --> 00:53:22.921
Vincent's case is unfortunate.

00:53:23.671 --> 00:53:24.910
But we're not totally defeated.

00:53:27.962 --> 00:53:34.128
If I were in charge,
I'd be more radical than you..

00:54:07.500 --> 00:54:08.249
Lau.

00:54:11.374 --> 00:54:12.124
Lau.

00:54:15.583 --> 00:54:19.040
The vault's director William Ngai
has taken half a month of annual leave

00:54:19.457 --> 00:54:20.657
without saying where he'll go.

00:54:20.998 --> 00:54:22.878
I'll check with
Immigration Department tomorrow.

00:54:26.123 --> 00:54:29.290
It's already 1 o'clock.
How about I drive you home.

00:54:45.538 --> 00:54:47.788
Lau, we've arrived.

00:54:48.871 --> 00:54:52.037
Go home to sleep. I'll
pick you up tomorrow.

00:54:56.704 --> 00:54:57.620
Vincent

00:55:40.616 --> 00:55:41.491
Excuse me, sir.

00:55:42.075 --> 00:55:43.533
I want a confidential briefing.

00:55:44.991 --> 00:55:47.782
I received a document this morning
from a sender signed "informer".

00:55:49.032 --> 00:55:51.753
It's a complaint against current
Deputy Police Commissioner Sean Lau,

00:55:51.949 --> 00:55:54.574
for allegedly accepting advantages
and perverting the course of justice.

00:55:54.782 --> 00:55:56.449
The complaint refers to

00:55:56.574 --> 00:55:58.323
the Tai Kok Tsui flyover gunfight
seven days ago.

00:55:58.406 --> 00:55:59.846
The trickiest thing about it is that

00:56:00.239 --> 00:56:02.281
one of those in the EU van,

00:56:02.864 --> 00:56:04.823
was the son of Deputy
Commissioner M.B. Lee.

00:56:05.323 --> 00:56:07.489
Police ranks of superintendent and above

00:56:07.573 --> 00:56:09.197
must all pass integrity checking.

00:56:09.405 --> 00:56:11.197
Billy, are you serious?

00:56:13.905 --> 00:56:15.988
For a month up to yesterday,

00:56:16.322 --> 00:56:19.487
at all the registered banks in Hong Kong,
all the counters

00:56:19.612 --> 00:56:21.612
received an amount of tracing paper

00:56:21.779 --> 00:56:25.779
totaling $319,500.

00:56:27.862 --> 00:56:30.403
I don't understand what you mean,

00:56:32.153 --> 00:56:33.028
Mr Chan.

00:56:33.153 --> 00:56:35.736
What I'm saying is that
we as the Hong Kong Monetary Authority

00:56:36.278 --> 00:56:37.718
never thought tracing paper prepared

00:56:37.778 --> 00:56:39.486
for law enforcement departments

00:56:39.570 --> 00:56:40.371
would be of any use.

00:56:40.652 --> 00:56:41.402
You make it sound like the money was lost

00:56:41.527 --> 00:56:43.735
because of us, Mr Chan

00:56:44.985 --> 00:56:46.902
Wait. Let me say something.

00:56:48.569 --> 00:56:51.651
Tracing paper, so-called
traceable banknotes,

00:56:52.526 --> 00:56:54.734
hasn't Worked well in tracking
down criminals at all.

00:56:55.234 --> 00:56:59.693
For the Monetary Authority
to prepare such money for us in future,

00:57:00.651 --> 00:57:02.171
we'd need to do further re-assessment.

00:57:04.025 --> 00:57:05.400
Sir, Independent
Commission Against Corruption officers.

00:57:05.525 --> 00:57:06.275
Mr Sean Lau,

00:57:07.358 --> 00:57:09.775
I'm ICAC Principal Investigation Officer
Billy Cheung.

00:57:10.108 --> 00:57:12.442
We suspect you violated the Prevention
of Bribery Ordinance, section 4.

00:57:12.567 --> 00:57:13.982
Please come with
us to assist in investigations.

00:57:14.232 --> 00:57:18.024
What do you mean?
Making an arrest at Police Headquarters,

00:57:18.149 --> 00:57:19.470
and it's the Deputy Commissioner?

00:57:25.773 --> 00:57:27.981
Mr Lau, please co-operate with us.

00:57:29.398 --> 00:57:30.481
Don't you know any rules?

00:57:31.773 --> 00:57:33.356
The people here are

00:57:33.440 --> 00:57:35.939
the top management
maintaining Hong Kong's safety.

00:57:37.105 --> 00:57:38.865
If you want to invite
Mr Lau to your office,

00:57:39.522 --> 00:57:41.772
you must give at least
half an hour's notice.

00:57:42.022 --> 00:57:45.272
Also, with such a big issue,
did you inform your boss?

00:57:46.354 --> 00:57:48.521
Half an hour? No problem.

00:57:48.688 --> 00:57:49.232
It's OK.

00:57:56.438 --> 00:57:59.103
Lee, I'll go with them.

00:58:29.642 --> 00:58:31.517
Sorry, Mr Lau. Kept you waiting so long.

00:58:32.850 --> 00:58:34.225
This is my assistant, W.M. Kwok.

00:58:37.392 --> 00:58:39.642
Be direct. Let's cut to the chase.

00:58:39.892 --> 00:58:40.599
Sure.

00:58:41.474 --> 00:58:42.914
We received a complaint against you.

00:58:43.141 --> 00:58:45.349
That's why we invited
you here to get more information.

00:58:45.683 --> 00:58:48.349
The force has an operation named Cold War.

00:58:49.849 --> 00:58:51.932
Judging by your experience and instinct,

00:58:53.015 --> 00:58:54.723
how easy would it be

00:58:55.223 --> 00:58:56.473
to hijack

00:58:56.598 --> 00:59:00.140
an EU van?

00:59:01.015 --> 00:59:03.597
Didn't you just say to be direct?

00:59:04.056 --> 00:59:06.431
Frankly, given today's
advanced technology,

00:59:07.222 --> 00:59:11.139
making an EU van vanish
is almost impossible.

00:59:11.847 --> 00:59:13.097
Unless it's an inside job.

00:59:14.888 --> 00:59:19.096
Do you think there's mole
in the Police Force, Mr Lau?

00:59:20.680 --> 00:59:22.471
After the Cold War operation,

00:59:23.138 --> 00:59:24.817
our Internal Affairs section opened a file

00:59:25.804 --> 00:59:28.387
for integrity checking
on each person in the van.

00:59:29.262 --> 00:59:33.179
"Before the report is completed,
I have no comment."

00:59:33.679 --> 00:59:36.928
Before operation Cold War,
because the Commissioner was out of town,

00:59:37.053 --> 00:59:38.344
M.B. Lee was initially

00:59:38.636 --> 00:59:40.136
the Acting Commissioner.

00:59:40.428 --> 00:59:41.828
But when Cold War went into action,

00:59:41.928 --> 00:59:44.803
you took over from him.

00:59:45.636 --> 00:59:49.343
That means you weren't originally

00:59:50.260 --> 00:59:52.052
the chief commander
of operation Cold War, right?

00:59:52.177 --> 00:59:52.777
That's correct.

00:59:52.885 --> 00:59:55.093
So may I know what criteria
the Police Force uses

00:59:55.218 --> 00:59:57.097
to assign the chief
commander for an operation?

00:59:57.217 --> 00:59:59.717
And what are the criteria
for changing a chief commander?

01:00:00.801 --> 01:00:02.884
Of course, the role of
Acting Commissioner is very important.

01:00:03.009 --> 01:00:04.884
What's the mechanism for assigning it?

01:00:05.092 --> 01:00:07.634
The answers are all in
the Police Force Ordinance.

01:00:08.633 --> 01:00:11.466
You can download it online
and find out yourself.

01:00:13.133 --> 01:00:14.841
This operation's report is

01:00:14.966 --> 01:00:16.883
very different from previous reports.

01:00:16.966 --> 01:00:18.767
That's why we asked you
to come here, Mr Lau.

01:00:19.965 --> 01:00:20.882
Given that there's no record

01:00:21.007 --> 01:00:22.007
about changing the operation commander,

01:00:22.132 --> 01:00:23.257
it's already a big issue!

01:00:26.632 --> 01:00:30.506
Do you know the difference
between a report and a log sheet?

01:00:35.173 --> 01:00:38.381
As the hijackers requested,
the force took the ransom from the vault.

01:00:38.839 --> 01:00:41.963
The hijackers requested a new number
and the total sum wasn't used up.

01:00:42.380 --> 01:00:45.005
Under legal principles,
the remaining money should've been classed

01:00:45.088 --> 01:00:46.338
as evidence and stored
in the evidence room.

01:00:46.672 --> 01:00:49.088
But why was it sent back to the vault
on the same day

01:00:49.213 --> 01:00:51.671
with minimum security instead?

01:01:02.586 --> 01:01:04.295
After Mr Lee surrendered his power,

01:01:04.920 --> 01:01:07.378
you wrote a cheque for $93.2 million

01:01:07.628 --> 01:01:11.378
in the name of Acting Police Commissioner.

01:01:12.878 --> 01:01:15.752
Mr Lau, on December 8,

01:01:15.919 --> 01:01:17.335
you were actually

01:01:18.502 --> 01:01:21.002
the most powerful person in Hong Kong

01:01:21.085 --> 01:01:22.245
for two hours that afternoon.

01:01:23.919 --> 01:01:25.043
Your every decision

01:01:25.584 --> 01:01:28.084
could have affected Hong Kong's security.

01:01:29.209 --> 01:01:33.418
Whatever my position is,
I always make the security of citizens

01:01:34.334 --> 01:01:36.833
the top priority in every decision.

01:01:37.458 --> 01:01:38.667
We're both in law enforcement.

01:01:40.083 --> 01:01:42.125
Do you remember one lesson
in the criminology course

01:01:42.583 --> 01:01:44.458
covered Stockholm Syndrome?

01:01:44.542 --> 01:01:47.332
Since you said we're both working
for law enforcement,

01:01:47.749 --> 01:01:50.374
why do you keep beating around the bush?

01:01:50.749 --> 01:01:54.249
Simply tell me What I've done wrong.

01:01:57.790 --> 01:02:01.831
Mr Lau, have you seen this document?

01:02:07.581 --> 01:02:08.247
No.

01:02:08.622 --> 01:02:11.182
Regarding this document,
we sent a letter to the Security Bureau.

01:02:11.414 --> 01:02:13.330
But they in turn asked us how we got it.

01:02:13.705 --> 01:02:16.830
We found your fingerprints
on this document.

01:02:17.664 --> 01:02:18.954
I need legal advice.

01:02:19.204 --> 01:02:20.454
We got permission from

01:02:20.579 --> 01:02:22.079
the Secretary for Justice to follow

01:02:22.204 --> 01:02:23.044
all your phone calls.

01:02:23.746 --> 01:02:25.204
We have sufficient criminal

01:02:25.288 --> 01:02:26.579
evidence on you.

01:02:28.454 --> 01:02:32.287
Tell me where's the $59 million

01:02:32.370 --> 01:02:33.787
in public money right now.

01:02:34.037 --> 01:02:37.370
Tell me, Mr Lau.

01:02:54.951 --> 01:02:56.752
Do you have a laptop
computer in your office?

01:02:59.326 --> 01:03:01.201
You said you have all the evidence.

01:03:02.410 --> 01:03:03.992
Show it to me now!

01:03:06.742 --> 01:03:10.534
If not, I'll give you
time to buy a computer.

01:03:15.616 --> 01:03:19.158
Also, can I call my lawyer?

01:03:27.448 --> 01:03:28.073
Speaking.

01:03:28.198 --> 01:03:30.073
If you can talk now, cough once.

01:03:33.282 --> 01:03:33.990
[cough-]

01:03:34.073 --> 01:03:37.239
May, go downstairs
to see Phoenix in the PR section.

01:03:37.531 --> 01:03:38.322
Ask if

01:03:38.822 --> 01:03:40.782
she has looked up the person
I asked her to check.

01:03:40.864 --> 01:03:43.406
Don't do it right now.
You know what I mean.

01:03:44.947 --> 01:03:45.572
Yes.

01:03:48.988 --> 01:03:49.738
Mr Ngai.

01:03:49.821 --> 01:03:50.363
Mr Lau.

01:03:50.530 --> 01:03:51.238
Sit down.

01:03:54.446 --> 01:03:56.406
Sorry to ask you to meet
in such a hurry, Mr Ngai.

01:03:58.070 --> 01:04:00.279
I followed the Hong Kong
news in Australia too.

01:04:01.029 --> 01:04:03.069
Never thought such
a big incident happened that day.

01:04:03.279 --> 01:04:04.320
Can you do me a favour?

01:04:05.737 --> 01:04:07.279
On December 8,

01:04:08.444 --> 01:04:10.028
did you ask my colleague Mr Tsui...

01:04:10.236 --> 01:04:10.986
Mr Tsui?

01:04:11.194 --> 01:04:12.528
To return money to the vault

01:04:13.486 --> 01:04:15.126
as soon as possible if it wasn't used up?

01:04:17.361 --> 01:04:18.403
No, I didn't.

01:04:30.192 --> 01:04:33.276
Mr Ngai, if you don't mind,
can my colleague go to your office

01:04:33.484 --> 01:04:36.276
to take a statement from
you tomorrow at noon?

01:04:36.942 --> 01:04:37.692
No problem.

01:04:38.734 --> 01:04:39.442
Thank you.

01:05:04.439 --> 01:05:07.356
Nicole speaking. OK.

01:05:08.189 --> 01:05:11.523
Billy, the Kowloon Bay vault's director
William Ngai just died.

01:05:11.856 --> 01:05:12.731
It's a car bomb.

01:05:21.647 --> 01:05:22.480
Looking for me?

01:05:26.521 --> 01:05:28.729
Colleagues are dealing
with Vincent's funeral.

01:05:32.437 --> 01:05:33.312
For me?

01:05:36.936 --> 01:05:38.737
He lost a lot of money
in the past half year.

01:05:38.811 --> 01:05:42.186
His apartment was mortgaged
to the bank three months ago.

01:06:45.389 --> 01:06:46.680
Did you eat?

01:06:48.639 --> 01:06:50.347
Let me cook noodles for you.

01:07:25.676 --> 01:07:27.076
I went to see Janet this afternoon.

01:07:29.968 --> 01:07:30.676
How is she?

01:07:31.468 --> 01:07:33.676
Vincent still has a lot
of things to settle.

01:07:34.260 --> 01:07:35.860
I should go over to help her these days.

01:07:38.009 --> 01:07:39.729
Have you ever been
betrayed by your friend?

01:07:44.592 --> 01:07:47.299
Billy, can you tell me
how you got hold of this CD-ROM?

01:07:47.716 --> 01:07:49.008
I can't at the moment.

01:07:49.133 --> 01:07:52.466
The contents are confidential
to the topmost level of the Police Force.

01:07:52.591 --> 01:07:54.508
With the highest confidentiality.

01:07:54.633 --> 01:07:56.216
There's no way a normal informant

01:07:56.341 --> 01:07:57.548
could obtain it.

01:07:57.965 --> 01:07:59.840
If the content inside is true,

01:08:00.173 --> 01:08:01.882
it may be beyond our power
to investigate further.

01:08:02.048 --> 01:08:03.928
But the informer seems familiar
with the police,

01:08:03.965 --> 01:08:06.465
the ICAC and the law.

01:08:06.673 --> 01:08:08.797
We are now the only people

01:08:08.881 --> 01:08:09.547
who can find out
the mastermind behind Cold War.

01:08:09.631 --> 01:08:12.047
We and the informer are
in the same boat now.

01:08:12.422 --> 01:08:13.214
We can't return.

01:08:14.547 --> 01:08:16.714
I know you always want to go back
to the accountability bureau, right?

01:08:16.881 --> 01:08:19.838
Billy, I've thought of it.
But this case is too complicated.

01:08:19.963 --> 01:08:21.213
This is the only chance.

01:08:21.630 --> 01:08:24.255
It could be the Watergate of our times.

01:08:26.380 --> 01:08:28.588
OK. I'll give you three days.

01:08:28.713 --> 01:08:29.213
Three days.

01:08:29.338 --> 01:08:30.004
Thank you, sir.

01:08:47.211 --> 01:08:48.961
According to sources,

01:08:49.128 --> 01:08:51.294
Deputy Police Commissioner Sean Lau

01:08:51.378 --> 01:08:54.002
was arrested by the
ICAC yesterday morning.

01:09:02.252 --> 01:09:04.251
Hello, I...

01:09:07.917 --> 01:09:08.709
Excuse me.

01:09:08.834 --> 01:09:10.959
If you keep throwing in questions like
this, we won't answer any questions.

01:09:11.042 --> 01:09:12.282
Let the Chinese media go first.

01:09:13.126 --> 01:09:15.416
Mr Luk, is Sean Lau being suspended now?

01:09:15.583 --> 01:09:17.250
He's taking leave for personal reasons.

01:09:17.291 --> 01:09:18.500
The opinion of the Police Force
is very low this year.

01:09:18.625 --> 01:09:20.041
Now the Deputy Police Commissioner
is even arrested by the ICAC.

01:09:20.166 --> 01:09:22.646
Should anyone in the accountability
bureau take responsibility?

01:09:22.958 --> 01:09:23.666
This question,

01:09:23.708 --> 01:09:24.582
Let's discuss it next time.

01:09:24.624 --> 01:09:26.749
Mr Luk, you've not once
said in public that

01:09:26.874 --> 01:09:28.665
you support Sean Lau to be
the next Police Commissioner.

01:09:28.749 --> 01:09:29.457
Did the ICAC operation

01:09:29.540 --> 01:09:31.082
mess up your deployment?

01:09:31.165 --> 01:09:31.540
I...

01:09:31.624 --> 01:09:32.957
Secretary Luk, what do you think about

01:09:33.040 --> 01:09:33.790
a high-ranking police official

01:09:33.915 --> 01:09:35.249
being arrested by the ICAC?

01:09:35.332 --> 01:09:37.123
Do you think Sean Lau
is guilty of bribery?

01:09:37.248 --> 01:09:38.539
Do you think you've
picked the wrong person?

01:09:38.664 --> 01:09:39.623
Would you take the blame and resign?

01:09:39.789 --> 01:09:41.081
Mr Luk, before taking action,

01:09:41.206 --> 01:09:43.123
did the ICAC inform the Security Bureau?

01:09:51.538 --> 01:09:53.080
I said it clearly:

01:09:53.372 --> 01:09:54.705
One at a time.

01:10:00.454 --> 01:10:02.954
Let me answer your questions all together.

01:10:04.537 --> 01:10:07.787
Deputy Commissioner Mr Lau
wasn't arrested by the ICAC.

01:10:08.204 --> 01:10:10.161
He's taking leave on personal grounds.

01:10:11.661 --> 01:10:14.703
I personally recognise his integrity
and capability very much.

01:10:16.370 --> 01:10:18.786
Another thing I want to
clarify again is that

01:10:19.120 --> 01:10:21.479
Hong Kong is an advanced city
under common law jurisdiction.

01:10:22.535 --> 01:10:24.869
The ICAC doesn't need to report to me

01:10:24.952 --> 01:10:26.744
before taking action.

01:10:30.035 --> 01:10:31.201
I understand.

01:10:32.034 --> 01:10:33.368
Even though you're free

01:10:33.493 --> 01:10:35.243
to ask any questions,

01:10:36.951 --> 01:10:39.618
please familiarise yourself
with Hong Kong law

01:10:39.701 --> 01:10:42.242
and the spirit of the rule of law
before you ask,

01:10:43.450 --> 01:10:46.450
because this is the core value that made

01:10:46.950 --> 01:10:48.783
Hong Kong an international
financial centre

01:10:49.367 --> 01:10:52.282
and Asia's safest city.

01:10:58.949 --> 01:11:00.407
M.B. Lee was a constable.

01:11:00.699 --> 01:11:02.699
Sean Lau rose from admin.

01:11:03.031 --> 01:11:04.573
Lau sir, 44 years old,

01:11:05.281 --> 01:11:08.198
is the youngest Deputy Commissioner
since the handover.

01:11:08.531 --> 01:11:10.781
Lee will be turning 51 next week.

01:11:10.906 --> 01:11:13.406
Commissioner Tsang
will retire in two and a half years.

01:11:13.615 --> 01:11:15.864
But so far, no one knows
who will be the successor,

01:11:16.447 --> 01:11:17.572
even within the force.

01:11:18.155 --> 01:11:19.835
Lee is hawkish and has always been popular

01:11:19.989 --> 01:11:22.489
among front-line officers,

01:11:22.905 --> 01:11:24.239
especially Criminal Investigation
Department detectives.

01:11:24.696 --> 01:11:27.446
He looks like the successor
under normal practice.

01:11:27.654 --> 01:11:29.855
But we were tipped off
by senior government sources that

01:11:30.821 --> 01:11:33.654
their ideal choice is actually Sean Lau.

01:11:34.654 --> 01:11:36.413
Because under his
management for four years,

01:11:36.487 --> 01:11:38.987
the force has been revamped very well.

01:11:39.403 --> 01:11:41.945
If no critical mistakes happen
in the force management

01:11:42.070 --> 01:11:43.487
in these few months,

01:11:43.653 --> 01:11:45.254
M.B. Lee would probably be urged to stay

01:11:45.320 --> 01:11:47.902
as Operations Deputy Police Commissioner
and then retire.

01:11:48.111 --> 01:11:49.402
Then Sean Lau could become

01:11:50.444 --> 01:11:52.111
Hong Kong's youngest

01:11:52.277 --> 01:11:54.027
Police Commissioner ever.

01:11:54.111 --> 01:11:56.027
Billy, do you think Lee

01:11:56.111 --> 01:11:57.818
wanted to strike out Sean Lau

01:11:57.985 --> 01:11:58.776
in case Lau would threaten his prospects?

01:11:59.068 --> 01:12:02.443
If you're making assumptions,
you might as well be bold.

01:12:15.109 --> 01:12:16.817
Nicole, call the government laboratory.

01:12:24.233 --> 01:12:25.834
Three days ago, I received critical info

01:12:25.941 --> 01:12:27.066
from the informer.

01:12:27.608 --> 01:12:29.524
Mr Mak has contacted the
Police Commissioner

01:12:29.691 --> 01:12:32.190
and they initially believed
the information is reliable.

01:12:32.690 --> 01:12:35.315
Tomorrow, we'll invite
Deputy Police Commissioner M.B. Lee here.

01:12:35.898 --> 01:12:38.773
We heard Lee is far
more sophisticated than Sean Lau.

01:12:38.982 --> 01:12:40.023
We have to be alert.

01:12:43.147 --> 01:12:45.106
Mr Lee, we brought you here so early,

01:12:45.689 --> 01:12:47.689
so hopefully it wouldn't scare you
and your family.

01:12:49.814 --> 01:12:52.355
Can you recall the names in this document?

01:12:53.021 --> 01:12:53.771
No.

01:12:53.896 --> 01:12:54.688
An EU van

01:12:54.896 --> 01:12:55.646
Not including minor players,

01:12:55.938 --> 01:12:57.898
there'd be a mole
who knows the operation details,

01:12:58.396 --> 01:13:00.105
an IT person who set up the whole system,

01:13:00.605 --> 01:13:01.980
your contact person,

01:13:02.563 --> 01:13:04.812
and of course a member in the EU van.

01:13:05.895 --> 01:13:07.937
At least four people were needed

01:13:08.062 --> 01:13:09.895
to extort the Hong Kong Police Force.

01:13:10.145 --> 01:13:11.645
Even if you had an IT
person as the fall guy

01:13:11.854 --> 01:13:13.094
and made the lost guns surface,

01:13:13.520 --> 01:13:16.103
the mole and the member
in the EU van would remain unknown.

01:13:16.769 --> 01:13:18.169
I totally don't know what you mean.

01:13:18.561 --> 01:13:22.144
In 1995, a perfect undercover plan

01:13:22.311 --> 01:13:25.393
successfully broke up a triad gang.

01:13:25.685 --> 01:13:26.810
The head of the Organised
Crime bureau then

01:13:26.977 --> 01:13:28.143
was M.B. Lee.

01:13:29.227 --> 01:13:31.602
After the job, due to safety,

01:13:32.102 --> 01:13:33.768
you vouched for the officers to join

01:13:33.852 --> 01:13:35.851
the last batch in the colonial
government's Identity Renewal Programme.

01:13:36.184 --> 01:13:37.642
They were even allowed
to change names legally

01:13:37.767 --> 01:13:40.101
and obtained right of
abode in South Africa.

01:13:40.684 --> 01:13:43.726
The file number of the program is ND157.

01:13:44.726 --> 01:13:48.183
You sound more like a cop
than an ICAC officer.

01:13:48.641 --> 01:13:50.600
Even the vault's director
was killed by you.

01:13:51.141 --> 01:13:53.782
Lots of current and old colleagues
even helped you stage a big show

01:13:54.058 --> 01:13:57.640
to clear Vincent Tsui
and kick out Sean Lau, right?

01:13:58.307 --> 01:13:59.932
You brought me here so early

01:14:01.932 --> 01:14:03.557
just to hear a story you made up.

01:14:04.432 --> 01:14:06.682
If there's nothing more, I have to go.

01:14:08.307 --> 01:14:11.848
Mr Lee, your planning
capability is really strong.

01:14:12.598 --> 01:14:15.514
Sean Lau has an impeccable resume
plus a strong support team,

01:14:15.848 --> 01:14:18.556
but all this was wiped out
by a so-called Cold War operation.

01:14:18.848 --> 01:14:20.930
According to records,
your father Lee Shu-tang

01:14:21.097 --> 01:14:22.930
was the highest-ranking
Chinese Police Superintendent

01:14:23.138 --> 01:14:25.097
and your son Joe Lee,
with a high IQ at 192,

01:14:25.222 --> 01:14:26.823
graduated with the Silver Whistle Award.

01:14:26.930 --> 01:14:29.305
The Lee family has three
honorable generations.

01:14:29.430 --> 01:14:30.389
Congratulations, Mr Lee.

01:14:30.929 --> 01:14:32.596
You must be the next Police Commissioner.

01:14:35.012 --> 01:14:36.929
Your imagination is too much.

01:14:37.262 --> 01:14:38.702
It's nothing to do with imagination.

01:14:39.054 --> 01:14:41.413
Your old colleague Yeung Chi-on
is sitting in the next room.

01:14:41.845 --> 01:14:44.511
Do you want me to bring
him here for a reunion?

01:14:50.303 --> 01:14:53.219
Kid, don't trick me.

01:14:54.177 --> 01:14:55.844
I can bet on my life that

01:14:56.885 --> 01:14:58.805
there's no one except your boss
in the next room.

01:15:03.509 --> 01:15:05.259
Just based on such a biased analysis,

01:15:05.843 --> 01:15:07.884
without any logical reasoning,

01:15:08.134 --> 01:15:11.176
you dare to bring in the two Deputy
Police Commissioners for questioning

01:15:11.593 --> 01:15:15.092
and waste their valuable time.
Isn't it exciting?

01:15:17.217 --> 01:15:22.008
Seize the hidden mastermind, smash the
big conspiracy in the Police Force.

01:15:23.217 --> 01:15:24.550
Don't you feel proud?

01:15:26.424 --> 01:15:27.841
When you've reached my position,

01:15:28.382 --> 01:15:30.216
you would understand.

01:15:33.424 --> 01:15:37.256
Even the Commissioner
would be amazed by my connections.

01:15:38.090 --> 01:15:39.048
What did you think

01:15:39.756 --> 01:15:42.006
you'd gain from questioning me?

01:15:44.298 --> 01:15:48.005
You assumed that one
of the Deputy Commissioners is the mole.

01:15:48.797 --> 01:15:51.880
Either Sean Lau wanted
to take the ransom money

01:15:52.672 --> 01:15:55.755
or I trapped him to get a promotion.

01:16:02.963 --> 01:16:04.754
I've been serving in the
force for 30 years,

01:16:05.421 --> 01:16:08.503
have many friends and have enemies too.

01:16:09.503 --> 01:16:11.337
In these 30 years, I learned one thing:

01:16:12.462 --> 01:16:13.583
no matter what organisation,

01:16:14.212 --> 01:16:15.962
department or position you're in,

01:16:16.212 --> 01:16:17.795
you first need to learn

01:16:18.878 --> 01:16:20.752
the rules of the game,

01:16:21.419 --> 01:16:23.919
whether they're written or unspoken.

01:16:24.919 --> 01:16:27.627
But many people failed to and died
before they learned them.

01:16:28.169 --> 01:16:29.169
Do you know why?

01:16:30.501 --> 01:16:31.701
Because they try to act smart.

01:16:31.960 --> 01:16:32.835
Second step,

01:16:33.918 --> 01:16:36.668
find the boundary in the game

01:16:37.835 --> 01:16:39.501
and don't

01:16:40.126 --> 01:16:42.167
overstep it.

01:16:42.917 --> 01:16:44.875
Only then can you barely survive.

01:16:47.042 --> 01:16:50.375
Can a city be run without the ICAC

01:16:51.000 --> 01:16:52.458
or without the police?

01:16:55.916 --> 01:17:01.083
Also, you two are still green. Watch out!

01:17:02.249 --> 01:17:05.832
Your boss is not a good person.

01:17:08.790 --> 01:17:09.540
Lee.

01:17:09.665 --> 01:17:10.582
Mak.

01:17:11.207 --> 01:17:11.873
This is the first time

01:17:11.998 --> 01:17:13.559
you've visited us after our relocation.

01:17:13.582 --> 01:17:14.497
Why didn't you tell me you'd dropped by?

01:17:15.039 --> 01:17:17.039
I was invited by the ICAC today

01:17:17.122 --> 01:17:19.039
to help in an investigation.

01:17:19.789 --> 01:17:20.914
According to Hong Kong law,

01:17:21.497 --> 01:17:24.289
the ICAC can detain me for 48 hours

01:17:24.372 --> 01:17:25.538
without complete evidence.

01:17:26.996 --> 01:17:28.580
I decided to stay here for a night.

01:17:28.913 --> 01:17:30.330
I'll give you two days

01:17:30.913 --> 01:17:31.788
and hope you can find

01:17:31.871 --> 01:17:33.288
sufficient evidence by all means

01:17:33.413 --> 01:17:35.080
to allow you to question me again.

01:17:35.413 --> 01:17:36.412
Don't be angry.

01:17:36.704 --> 01:17:38.224
You're the Deputy Police Commissioner.

01:17:38.245 --> 01:17:40.954
We just want to help the force
to clean out the black marks.

01:17:41.079 --> 01:17:42.359
Come on. Come over to my office.

01:17:42.912 --> 01:17:44.552
You now know how to play the game, right?

01:18:06.118 --> 01:18:06.618
Mr Lee.

01:18:06.660 --> 01:18:07.660
Mr Lau wants to see you.

01:19:15.361 --> 01:19:16.070
Looking for me?

01:19:22.945 --> 01:19:24.111
Winston Churchill said

01:19:24.528 --> 01:19:26.485
all wars are unnecessary.

01:19:28.444 --> 01:19:29.194
What do you mean?

01:19:36.443 --> 01:19:38.443
The report from
the government laboratory came in.

01:19:38.568 --> 01:19:41.318
It's confirmed that the bomb
in William Ngai's car

01:19:41.401 --> 01:19:42.482
was made with black powder.

01:19:42.818 --> 01:19:45.193
Sulphur, charcoal and potassium nitrate?

01:19:47.650 --> 01:19:49.608
Those are the main ingredients
for black powder.

01:19:49.858 --> 01:19:50.608
Excuse me.

01:19:50.942 --> 01:19:51.900
What is black powder?

01:19:52.275 --> 01:19:53.942
Black powder is a low-level explosive

01:19:54.400 --> 01:19:55.858
used mainly in fireworks.

01:19:56.650 --> 01:19:57.816
Don't take it lightly.

01:19:58.024 --> 01:20:00.024
Within 4,000 square feet,
it can still kill people.

01:20:00.316 --> 01:20:01.357
They wanted to push the blame onto Vincent

01:20:01.482 --> 01:20:02.982
and the vault's director

01:20:04.107 --> 01:20:05.816
with their deaths.

01:20:06.274 --> 01:20:08.024
The hijacking's mastermind is obviously

01:20:09.273 --> 01:20:10.606
from inside the force.

01:20:14.440 --> 01:20:15.773
No matter whether any of us

01:20:15.856 --> 01:20:17.606
continue investigating under Cold War,

01:20:18.648 --> 01:20:19.897
they'd certainly know about it.

01:20:21.564 --> 01:20:23.772
If they don't do anything
more or simply hide away,

01:20:24.772 --> 01:20:29.439
we'll never crack the case.

01:20:29.855 --> 01:20:31.646
Mr Mak, the ICAC is the only

01:20:31.771 --> 01:20:34.251
law enforcement body reporting
directly to the Chief Executive.

01:20:34.271 --> 01:20:35.646
Even the Security Bureau
has no authority over it.

01:20:35.813 --> 01:20:38.021
According to the structure,
the ICAC doesn't need to report to me

01:20:38.104 --> 01:20:39.646
before their operations.

01:20:41.229 --> 01:20:42.645
Trust your own judgment.

01:20:43.062 --> 01:20:45.645
Extreme times require extreme measures.

01:20:46.478 --> 01:20:49.020
I think the informer wants to use the ICAC

01:20:49.145 --> 01:20:50.145
to dig out the criminals.

01:20:56.602 --> 01:20:57.269
Hello?

01:20:58.519 --> 01:20:59.977
Are you the informer?

01:21:00.102 --> 01:21:02.061
If Lau didn't ask us to help,

01:21:02.269 --> 01:21:03.976
he could be the one being kicked out.

01:21:09.768 --> 01:21:14.225
44 buildings in Hong Kong
can release fireworks.

01:21:14.600 --> 01:21:16.600
But only 20 people hold
black powder licenses.

01:21:17.017 --> 01:21:18.737
They're responsible for
the firework shows.

01:21:18.934 --> 01:21:21.334
We checked all the firework technicians
at these 44 buildings

01:21:21.767 --> 01:21:23.047
and have targeted three of them.

01:21:23.517 --> 01:21:25.433
If we can find the bomber,

01:21:25.516 --> 01:21:27.183
we can then find the hijackers.

01:21:27.558 --> 01:21:29.183
The autopsy report for Johnny Wong said

01:21:30.224 --> 01:21:33.849
his whole body, including hair and nails,

01:21:34.391 --> 01:21:36.790
showed ferric oxide residues,
plus soil from the environment.

01:21:36.890 --> 01:21:38.640
According to statements
from the other four EU van members,

01:21:39.015 --> 01:21:40.557
all said they'd been kept at

01:21:41.307 --> 01:21:42.473
a scrap yard.

01:21:43.182 --> 01:21:45.182
This matched with the report.

01:21:47.306 --> 01:21:49.264
But I still have some reservations.

01:21:50.347 --> 01:21:53.389
Three days ago,
I asked the government laboratory

01:21:53.889 --> 01:21:56.570
to conduct further comparison
for the other four officers' clothing.

01:21:56.764 --> 01:21:58.305
Among the four van officers,

01:21:58.596 --> 01:22:01.471
three of them only had
one type of environmental element,

01:22:02.263 --> 01:22:04.971
but one of them had more than one.

01:22:06.513 --> 01:22:07.721
The only explanation is that

01:22:08.430 --> 01:22:13.554
this person had been
to the same place more than once.

01:22:14.012 --> 01:22:16.372
Do you remember there was a typhoon
in Hong Kong last month?

01:22:16.512 --> 01:22:18.762
Wind and rain diluted the soil.

01:22:21.886 --> 01:22:25.178
Nature became our time witness.

01:22:25.844 --> 01:22:28.928
The more careful a person is,
the more preparation he'd carry out.

01:22:30.593 --> 01:22:32.802
The hijack video
needed to be recorded in advance

01:22:33.343 --> 01:22:36.468
to have enough time to make sure
all the background information

01:22:36.593 --> 01:22:37.635
could be cleared.

01:22:38.302 --> 01:22:41.759
Although he has been very careful,

01:22:43.717 --> 01:22:46.926
the facts are always the most precise.

01:22:49.717 --> 01:22:52.758
According to sources,
when a firework is assembled on a roof,

01:22:53.175 --> 01:22:55.508
it's as dangerous as an explosives depot.

01:22:56.216 --> 01:22:57.383
Be careful, everybody!

01:22:57.800 --> 01:23:00.091
Killing the vault's director

01:23:00.175 --> 01:23:04.924
and leaving traces of black powder:
the clue is too obvious.

01:23:05.049 --> 01:23:06.489
The only logical explanation is that

01:23:06.507 --> 01:23:07.757
the mole

01:23:07.924 --> 01:23:09.465
who hijacked the EU van

01:23:10.049 --> 01:23:12.424
started to clear away witnesses
with outside help.

01:23:12.632 --> 01:23:14.391
He'd rather betray
outsiders who helped him,

01:23:15.589 --> 01:23:16.089
Bun.

01:23:16.131 --> 01:23:17.052
See you in the gondola.

01:23:19.131 --> 01:23:21.381
It's Team B. We've arrived
at the south roof.

01:23:29.088 --> 01:23:29.928
Are you Albert Kwong?

01:23:29.963 --> 01:23:30.588
Speaking.

01:23:30.963 --> 01:23:33.443
Remember Chan Bun, who was
at Organised Crime and Triad Bureau?

01:23:35.463 --> 01:23:38.712
I want to be a witness in return
for immunity. I have things to say.

01:23:39.796 --> 01:23:41.254
See me on the roof now.

01:23:41.796 --> 01:23:44.004
OK. Wait for me.

01:23:48.336 --> 01:23:49.545
Michael... Michael

01:23:57.545 --> 01:24:02.335
Michael... Get Michael
and tell him to answer me.

01:24:02.377 --> 01:24:03.044
Yes sir

01:25:08.288 --> 01:25:09.121
GO, gov

01:25:47.992 --> 01:25:48.909
I'm Albert.

01:26:07.574 --> 01:26:10.254
Long time, no see. You'd been doing
very well, Superintendent Kwong.

01:26:20.906 --> 01:26:22.027
How long have you been back?

01:26:24.906 --> 01:26:26.546
I only want to know who else is involved.

01:26:26.614 --> 01:26:28.815
I'll only tell you
if the policemen downstairs back off.

01:26:32.988 --> 01:26:36.071
Calm down and put down the gun.

01:26:36.571 --> 01:26:37.988
How many are hurt below us?

01:26:38.488 --> 01:26:39.405
You tell me to put the gun down?

01:26:39.530 --> 01:26:40.238
Michael

01:26:48.529 --> 01:26:49.695
Give me some time.

01:26:50.695 --> 01:26:51.945
I'll be able to settle it.

01:26:52.195 --> 01:26:53.319
I can ensure your safety.

01:26:55.736 --> 01:26:56.944
Why did you betray me?

01:26:58.361 --> 01:26:59.986
Why did you betray me?

01:27:04.360 --> 01:27:05.818
Michael, why did you betray me?

01:27:23.609 --> 01:27:24.651
Go to hell!

01:28:00.022 --> 01:28:00.813
Dad.

01:28:01.188 --> 01:28:02.789
It's so late. Why aren't you asleep yet?

01:28:03.188 --> 01:28:04.522
Lau has something for you.

01:28:34.477 --> 01:28:35.894
What an oversight!

01:28:36.227 --> 01:28:37.227
Why?

01:28:45.309 --> 01:28:48.434
Actually, many seniors are on your side.

01:28:49.434 --> 01:28:52.808
Not only me but many people
beyond your imagination.

01:28:53.308 --> 01:28:54.975
They've been helping me all along.

01:28:55.183 --> 01:28:57.850
How about Vincent? Johnny Wong?

01:28:58.600 --> 01:29:01.225
They're policemen too. They have families.

01:29:01.642 --> 01:29:04.307
The first day in the academy,
the instructor helped clear my mind.

01:29:04.807 --> 01:29:05.432
He said my work

01:29:05.474 --> 01:29:07.182
would add a degree of danger to my life.

01:29:07.516 --> 01:29:10.116
This is part of the cost of fighting
for our rights and interests.

01:29:10.182 --> 01:29:11.516
I don't see any problem with it.

01:29:16.181 --> 01:29:18.422
Have you forgotten
what I've been teaching you all along?

01:29:18.681 --> 01:29:20.931
I haven't forgotten what you taught me,

01:29:21.473 --> 01:29:22.598
but times have changed.

01:29:23.515 --> 01:29:25.235
No one acknowledges you
for helping people.

01:29:26.055 --> 01:29:29.222
If you let other people get promoted,
even God won't help you.

01:29:30.180 --> 01:29:31.741
I never knew you'd already gone so far.

01:29:32.764 --> 01:29:34.180
I want to ask you a question.

01:29:35.222 --> 01:29:37.471
If you were me, what would you do?

01:29:39.888 --> 01:29:40.679
I...

01:29:42.471 --> 01:29:44.138
I won't turn myself in.

01:29:44.721 --> 01:29:45.888
I won't go to jail.

01:29:46.804 --> 01:29:47.970
If I were you,

01:29:51.137 --> 01:29:52.553
I'd let your son go!

01:29:52.678 --> 01:29:54.039
Why are you so confident about it?

01:29:54.470 --> 01:29:55.928
Because I'm your only son.

01:30:22.217 --> 01:30:25.217
Since Sean Lau's in charge,
all he knows is how to reduce expenses

01:30:25.300 --> 01:30:28.134
to make the accounts look nice
and please the bosses.

01:30:28.425 --> 01:30:30.425
You know how low morale
is at the front line?

01:30:30.592 --> 01:30:32.424
The present Commissioner
is disappointing us.

01:30:32.674 --> 01:30:33.591
I won't let someone like him

01:30:33.716 --> 01:30:35.591
take the Commissioner post again.

01:30:36.466 --> 01:30:37.133
Dad,

01:30:37.841 --> 01:30:39.383
many colleagues support you.

01:30:40.091 --> 01:30:42.840
We'll have hope only if
you take the position.

01:30:43.548 --> 01:30:45.090
How many are with you?

01:30:46.340 --> 01:30:47.590
More than you could imagine.

01:30:49.507 --> 01:30:52.007
I've decided, if anything goes wrong,

01:30:52.590 --> 01:30:54.547
I'll sacrifice a few colleagues first.

01:30:54.922 --> 01:30:58.297
In a few days, I'll let the lost
guns and the ransom surface,

01:30:58.589 --> 01:31:00.047
and you're the one who'll solve the case.

01:31:00.214 --> 01:31:02.089
Dad, just one step left.

01:31:03.172 --> 01:31:04.546
I did so much.

01:31:04.838 --> 01:31:06.380
Just the final step for you to take.

01:31:10.296 --> 01:31:15.795
Joe, you'd better answer
my earlier question first.

01:31:27.294 --> 01:31:30.586
If I were you, I wouldn't
find so many excuses

01:31:30.711 --> 01:31:32.044
to do so many wrong things.

01:31:42.210 --> 01:31:43.377
I love you, Dad.

01:32:08.666 --> 01:32:10.499
I wanted to see how much he'd changed

01:32:10.832 --> 01:32:12.272
and how much of the old him is left.

01:32:13.249 --> 01:32:16.624
If he didn't pick up the gun,
he would still have hope.

01:32:17.832 --> 01:32:19.582
But he picked up the gun.

01:32:20.123 --> 01:32:21.831
Since then he is no longer my son.

01:32:22.789 --> 01:32:27.289
His future, dead or alive,
has nothing to do with me.

01:32:59.745 --> 01:33:01.306
I've been wrongly tipped off all along.

01:33:01.703 --> 01:33:04.062
How could others say Lee
is far more sophisticated than you?

01:33:04.202 --> 01:33:06.452
Mr Lau, you're incredible!

01:33:09.119 --> 01:33:13.535
Have you ever thought
of joining me in the force?

01:33:16.868 --> 01:33:18.034
Call me.

01:33:40.282 --> 01:33:40.949
Come in.

01:33:42.657 --> 01:33:43.282
Sir

01:33:43.366 --> 01:33:44.032
Sit down.

01:33:52.490 --> 01:33:55.573
Commissioner Tsang, I have a question.

01:33:55.698 --> 01:33:56.978
I know what you're going to ask.

01:33:58.280 --> 01:34:01.655
It's because both Lee
and I have applied for early retirement.

01:34:02.614 --> 01:34:05.447
Lau, I can't do much more.

01:34:07.197 --> 01:34:09.154
The future of the Police
Force depends on you.

01:34:20.945 --> 01:34:21.778
Lee.

01:34:22.987 --> 01:34:23.820
Sir

01:34:27.862 --> 01:34:30.695
Rule number one: As a superior,

01:34:30.778 --> 01:34:32.657
you never run out to look
for your subordinates.

01:34:33.361 --> 01:34:35.361
Only the opposite should happen.

01:34:35.569 --> 01:34:36.569
Sorry sir

01:34:36.902 --> 01:34:38.652
I should be the one who says that.

01:34:40.569 --> 01:34:42.328
You have no practical
operations experience,

01:34:42.985 --> 01:34:45.068
but this became your advantage.

01:34:45.610 --> 01:34:47.776
You can look at a case
from a wider perspective.

01:34:48.318 --> 01:34:50.901
Without violating the
law or abusing power,

01:34:51.318 --> 01:34:52.735
every department in the force,

01:34:53.234 --> 01:34:55.859
the ICAC and even the Security Bureau

01:34:56.275 --> 01:34:57.817
became your tools to solve the case.

01:34:59.692 --> 01:35:01.359
I doubted your capability all along.

01:35:02.817 --> 01:35:04.233
I was too subjective.

01:35:05.358 --> 01:35:06.358
Thank you, sir.

01:35:06.649 --> 01:35:08.358
But you were wrong on something.

01:35:09.691 --> 01:35:14.149
In World War ll, when
US President Roosevelt

01:35:14.524 --> 01:35:16.190
asked UK Prime Minister Churchill

01:35:16.273 --> 01:35:18.023
how to describe the war,

01:35:18.190 --> 01:35:19.107
Churchill said

01:35:20.398 --> 01:35:24.148
it was an unnecessary war
that could have been avoided.

01:35:24.607 --> 01:35:26.897
He never said all wars are unnecessary.

01:35:27.772 --> 01:35:29.106
The Gathering Storm.

01:35:29.564 --> 01:35:31.814
The last paragraph on the first page.

01:35:32.272 --> 01:35:34.147
I shouldn't have shown
off in front of you.

01:36:14.768 --> 01:36:17.435
Operation Cold War was identified
as both a success and a failure

01:36:17.518 --> 01:36:20.060
in government internal review records.

01:36:21.726 --> 01:36:23.684
The records said management
at the Hong Kong police and the ICAC,

01:36:23.726 --> 01:36:26.086
could remain neutral
and they could stick to their positions

01:36:29.684 --> 01:36:32.364
It is an excellent model for cities
following the common law system.

01:36:32.808 --> 01:36:35.183
The review document raised
a number of improvement measures.

01:36:35.225 --> 01:36:37.558
However, after internal assessment
by the government,

01:36:37.600 --> 01:36:39.933
all records are classified as confidential
and cannot be made public

01:36:39.975 --> 01:36:42.349
due to public safety considerations.

01:37:00.806 --> 01:37:02.407
May I know who wants to speak to Mr Lau?

01:37:02.973 --> 01:37:06.180
Please hold on.

01:37:10.305 --> 01:37:11.347
Hello?

01:37:11.513 --> 01:37:14.513
Commissioner Lau, do
you still remember me?

01:37:16.387 --> 01:37:17.137
Yes, I remember.

01:37:17.762 --> 01:37:19.554
Your wife is Michelle Chan,

01:37:19.679 --> 01:37:21.429
the person in charge at Sunflower Florist.

01:37:22.262 --> 01:37:23.804
Your daughter is 5 years old.

01:37:24.554 --> 01:37:28.553
Sunshine Flower Kindergarten grade 3,
Josie Lau.

01:37:29.345 --> 01:37:30.136
What do you want?

01:37:31.095 --> 01:37:32.553
I want you to release someone.

01:37:33.305 --> 01:37:39.771
