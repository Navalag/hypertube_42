Get to it.

00:02:25.444 --> 00:02:26.580
Jackson! No!

00:02:51.687 --> 00:02:53.710
Ahh.

00:03:04.627 --> 00:03:06.525
Roger.

00:03:07.630 --> 00:03:11.591
You're a wonderful man, yes,
and you're a great lawyer.

00:03:12.592 --> 00:03:14.594
We're just not meant to be together.

00:03:17.618 --> 00:03:20.558
No, I don't wanna marry you!
Are you crazy?

00:03:20.590 --> 00:03:22.560
The hell's the matter with you?

00:03:23.582 --> 00:03:24.708
Roger, we're done.

00:03:25.668 --> 00:03:27.597
Oh, my God.

00:03:29.703 --> 00:03:32.611
Fuck! God!

00:03:33.664 --> 00:03:35.645
Hurgh!

00:03:35.677 --> 00:03:37.595
Fucking men!

00:03:45.635 --> 00:03:48.553
- Did he cry?
- Yeah, he cried. He laughed.

00:03:48.585 --> 00:03:50.586
He yelled at me.
You know, whatever.

00:03:50.618 --> 00:03:52.693
- You broke his heart, Mama.
- I did the right thing.

00:03:52.724 --> 00:03:55.633
- Ally, garbage!
- It just wasn't right... Oh, hey, Bryan.

00:03:55.664 --> 00:03:57.646
- Can somebody else do it?
- Let her shine!

00:03:57.677 --> 00:03:59.637
It's your fucking turn!

00:03:59.668 --> 00:04:01.681
- Oh, my God!
- Who's he talking to?

00:04:01.712 --> 00:04:03.599
OK, I'll see you upstairs.

00:04:03.631 --> 00:04:05.747
Come on, Bryan!
She's performing tonight!

00:04:06.665 --> 00:04:08.729
Here we go. Taking out the trash.
Wipe your mouth.

00:04:08.761 --> 00:04:10.742
You can go early if you finish your job.

00:04:10.773 --> 00:04:13.640
Well, you gotta keep your mouth clean.
OK?

00:05:02.718 --> 00:05:05.679
Ohh. Where the fuck are we?

00:05:06.680 --> 00:05:09.840
We are uh...east of the city.

00:05:10.621 --> 00:05:12.654
- Is there any more?
- No.

00:05:12.685 --> 00:05:13.843
No, sorry, Jack.

00:05:14.625 --> 00:05:18.608
And it's... It's about an hour, 40,
with traffic till we get there.

00:05:18.639 --> 00:05:20.641
- Really?
- Yeah.

00:05:20.672 --> 00:05:22.779
Think we can find something around here?

00:05:23.686 --> 00:05:25.719
No, I'll find something.
I'll find something.

00:05:25.750 --> 00:05:28.660
How's your kid?
How old is he now?

00:05:28.691 --> 00:05:31.714
- He is 17.
- Fuck me.

00:05:31.745 --> 00:05:35.801
And he got a scholarship
to play baseball in college already, man.

00:05:35.832 --> 00:05:38.804
- Wow, that's great.
- I'm proud of him.

00:05:40.629 --> 00:05:42.735
My little guy is not so little any more.

00:05:42.766 --> 00:05:44.841
I don't wanna go home.

00:05:46.718 --> 00:05:48.814
Wish I could find you a spot.

00:05:48.845 --> 00:05:51.869
- Sorry, Jack, I don't know this area.
- Would you make a right here?

00:05:52.650 --> 00:05:53.808
- You sure?
- Yeah.

00:05:53.839 --> 00:05:55.872
All right.

00:05:57.770 --> 00:05:59.803
Here we go.
That looks like a fucking bar.

00:05:59.834 --> 00:06:01.805
- Here?
- What's that say? "Bleu Bleu."

00:06:01.836 --> 00:06:03.797
Here, let me just try this.

00:06:08.843 --> 00:06:11.710
Oh, shit.

00:06:11.857 --> 00:06:13.785
Wait, wait.

00:06:13.816 --> 00:06:16.892
- My man, my man, I... Aren't you like...
- This is a bar, right?

00:06:17.674 --> 00:06:19.895
- Yeah, but not your kind of place.
- They got alcohol?

00:06:20.677 --> 00:06:22.721
- Well, yeah, but...
- Oh, it's my kind of place.

00:06:23.670 --> 00:06:24.869
Oh, shit! This is crazy!

00:06:24.900 --> 00:06:27.736
How are you doin', papo?

00:06:27.768 --> 00:06:29.770
How am I doin'?
All right, if I can get a drink.

00:06:29.801 --> 00:06:31.687
- You good?
- Yeah.

00:06:31.865 --> 00:06:34.763
- Oh, yeah. There's the bar.
- This is my home girl Giselle.

00:06:34.795 --> 00:06:36.776
- How you doin'?
- Oh, yeah. That's Jack.

00:06:39.779 --> 00:06:42.719
Can we get this man
anything he wants, please?

00:06:42.750 --> 00:06:43.918
Can I get a gin on the rocks...

00:06:50.695 --> 00:06:51.853
Papo, wow.

00:06:52.718 --> 00:06:54.709
Oh, my gosh.
I'm freaking out right now.

00:06:54.741 --> 00:06:56.857
- Hey, is this a drag bar?
- Yeah, papo. Yeah, yeah.

00:06:56.888 --> 00:07:00.778
But, look, we do this every Friday night.
Yo, it's crazy. It's so lit, though.

00:07:00.809 --> 00:07:03.854
I thought maybe I was in
some sort of hallucinogenic state.

00:07:03.885 --> 00:07:05.845
- Or something.
- No, no. All are welcome.

00:07:05.877 --> 00:07:07.733
A dress or something.

00:07:07.764 --> 00:07:09.766
Gonna have something?
Let me get you a drink.

00:07:09.797 --> 00:07:11.736
OK. Yeah, um, wow.

00:07:11.945 --> 00:07:15.792
You better kill 'em tonight.
All you ladies, kill it tonight, OK?

00:07:15.823 --> 00:07:16.887
- I'm ready.
- I always do!

00:07:16.918 --> 00:07:19.744
Make sure you've turned in
your music already.

00:07:19.775 --> 00:07:21.840
Don't make me
have to come get you tonight.

00:07:21.871 --> 00:07:23.873
This is a professional show.

00:07:26.824 --> 00:07:28.961
Oh, yes! Oh, you stayed!

00:07:29.743 --> 00:07:31.829
- That's good. I like it.
- Everything good? You good?

00:07:31.860 --> 00:07:33.861
Yeah, I was just talking to Nicki.
You know Nicki?

00:07:33.893 --> 00:07:36.926
- Hello, Nicki. How you doin', baby?
- She's telling me her life story.

00:07:36.958 --> 00:07:39.763
- Fascinating.
- My home girl's about to perform.

00:07:39.794 --> 00:07:41.984
Y'all know her well
because she used to work here as a server.

00:07:42.766 --> 00:07:47.937
But, tonight, the only thing she's serving
are some fabulous, French live vocals.

00:07:53.870 --> 00:07:56.810
Is she really singing,
or is it one of those karaoke things?

00:07:56.841 --> 00:07:59.823
No, she's really singing, papo.
I promise you. Watch this. Watch.

00:09:43.933 --> 00:09:46.905
Would anybody like
some French tips tonight?

00:10:54.135 --> 00:10:56.929
Yes, baby! Yes, baby!

00:10:58.097 --> 00:10:59.160
Oh, fuck.

00:10:59.942 --> 00:11:01.955
- Oh, papo, you crying?
- A little bit.

00:11:03.175 --> 00:11:05.104
You have...
You have to meet her.

00:11:05.135 --> 00:11:07.033
- What's that?
- You have to meet her!

00:11:07.064 --> 00:11:09.076
- Oh, no, I can't meet her.
- Yes! Come on.

00:11:09.108 --> 00:11:13.018
Donte, you got a rag, honey? Thank you.

00:11:13.049 --> 00:11:16.177
Miss Ally, now you sang in French,
you gonna pick something else next week?

00:11:16.958 --> 00:11:18.981
- I don't know.
- Look at her, doing languages.

00:11:19.012 --> 00:11:20.952
- Do Moroccan.
- No!

00:11:20.983 --> 00:11:22.985
- This is my friend, Jackson Maine.
- Hey.

00:11:23.016 --> 00:11:24.987
- This is Jackson Maine.
- Hey. How are you?

00:11:25.018 --> 00:11:28.157
- Hey! Oh, my God!
- Right? This is my friend, Ally.

00:11:28.188 --> 00:11:29.200
- Hi.
- Hey.

00:11:29.982 --> 00:11:32.057
- I thought that might be you.
- What'd you say?

00:11:32.088 --> 00:11:34.132
- I thought that might be you.
- That's me.

00:11:34.163 --> 00:11:36.039
Thank you! Do you wanna sit down?

00:11:36.070 --> 00:11:39.115
- No! You've been on your feet all night.
- No! You're our guest.

00:11:39.146 --> 00:11:41.169
- You sure you don't mind?
- A little drink?

00:11:41.200 --> 00:11:44.026
- I'm here watching the show - you guys.
- Word.

00:11:44.057 --> 00:11:45.152
- Yeah, yeah.
- Sign my boob?

00:11:45.183 --> 00:11:47.133
- Sure. Yeah, I can do that.
- Oh, my God!

00:11:47.164 --> 00:11:50.053
- Give me a sharpie!
- You know, it's BYOB around here.

00:11:50.084 --> 00:11:51.982
- Yeah?
- "Bring your own boobs."

00:11:52.013 --> 00:11:55.027
Oh, God!
Oh, those aren't really her boobs?

00:11:56.226 --> 00:11:58.039
Wow!

00:11:58.070 --> 00:12:00.010
So, why are you in here, hon?

00:12:00.041 --> 00:12:01.157
- Sorry?
- What brings you here?

00:12:01.188 --> 00:12:05.025
I was playing right around here tonight.
I'm a musician.

00:12:05.056 --> 00:12:08.122
- How'd your show go?
- I think it went all right.

00:12:09.165 --> 00:12:11.125
- OK, here we go. All right.
- Thank you!

00:12:11.156 --> 00:12:13.148
- That's all right?
- Oh, my.

00:12:13.179 --> 00:12:15.139
- Aahh.
- Which one should I do?

00:12:15.171 --> 00:12:17.130
- Do 'em both! I don't care!
- Slut!

00:12:17.162 --> 00:12:19.194
- Why don't I do it across?
- Bitch, Jackson Maine!

00:12:19.226 --> 00:12:21.134
- I'll just...
- Oh, my!

00:12:21.165 --> 00:12:25.034
Ohh, she will stop at nothing.

00:12:25.065 --> 00:12:27.182
- You gotta blow on it!
- I did it pretty big. Oh.

00:12:27.213 --> 00:12:29.194
- Oh, you got it. OK.
- Thank you so much!

00:12:29.225 --> 00:12:31.248
You all gotta go home
but you know the phrase.

00:12:32.030 --> 00:12:33.177
You gotta get the hell up outta here!

00:12:33.208 --> 00:12:36.107
Cos I'm not losing my virginity
or my liquor licence

00:12:36.139 --> 00:12:38.035
over you bitches, so pack up!

00:12:38.067 --> 00:12:40.089
- That's right!
- That's enough cocktails!

00:12:40.121 --> 00:12:42.123
Clear it out!
Hello, goodbye, Roger.

00:12:42.154 --> 00:12:44.062
Have fun!

00:12:44.093 --> 00:12:46.241
- Bring the drinks on out!
- Do you do that often?

00:12:47.190 --> 00:12:49.088
- Do what?
- The show.

00:12:49.119 --> 00:12:51.267
Yeah, yeah.
The girls are so nice to me here.

00:12:52.049 --> 00:12:55.219
I mean, they would never normally
let a girl sing at one of these shows

00:12:55.250 --> 00:12:57.211
but they've always loved my voice.

00:12:57.242 --> 00:12:59.253
They used to beg me to sing.

00:12:59.286 --> 00:13:02.267
It's an honour, really.
I get to be one of the gay girls.

00:13:03.049 --> 00:13:04.217
Is that your real eyebrow?

00:13:06.135 --> 00:13:08.169
Um... No. No.

00:13:09.117 --> 00:13:11.203
I... I make it out of tape.

00:13:12.173 --> 00:13:14.206
- Oh, so it's, like, stuck on?
- Mm-hm.

00:13:17.114 --> 00:13:18.283
Can I try to take it off?

00:13:19.251 --> 00:13:22.088
Uh... Yeah, sure.

00:13:23.141 --> 00:13:25.143
It's incredible what they do.

00:13:31.170 --> 00:13:33.224
- Look at that.
- Yep. There it is.

00:13:33.255 --> 00:13:35.309
- I should put her down somewhere.
- OK.

00:13:38.239 --> 00:13:39.324
There we go.

00:13:40.313 --> 00:13:42.242
Why are you covering your eye?

00:13:42.273 --> 00:13:44.265
Just cos I don't have
my eyebrow on any more.

00:13:44.296 --> 00:13:47.237
Oh, no, no.
The whole point is I can see your face.

00:13:48.196 --> 00:13:50.156
Yeah, there we go.

00:13:55.339 --> 00:13:58.111
Why did you come back here?

00:13:58.269 --> 00:14:01.260
Your friend brought me back here.
I'm glad he did.

00:14:01.291 --> 00:14:03.304
Can I buy you a drink?

00:14:04.222 --> 00:14:08.163
Oh... I... I gotta change,
and I've got paint in my hair.

00:14:08.194 --> 00:14:10.269
- And my eyebrows are...
- That's not your real hair?

00:14:10.300 --> 00:14:12.282
No, my hair's like your colour.

00:14:12.313 --> 00:14:15.180
- Oh, OK.
- But I paint it with this...

00:14:16.150 --> 00:14:18.224
- ..makeup.
- I'd love to see what that looks like.

00:14:19.320 --> 00:14:21.206
I'll wait for you.

00:14:23.146 --> 00:14:25.242
Um... Yeah, OK. Sure.

00:14:25.273 --> 00:14:28.234
Yeah, if you wanna wait,
I'll come have a drink with you.

00:14:28.265 --> 00:14:30.184
Sure.

00:14:30.215 --> 00:14:33.375
Bitch, can you get down off that stage
and come help me close this bar, please?

00:14:34.157 --> 00:14:36.263
Don't talk to me like that
in that bus driver wig, girl.

00:14:36.294 --> 00:14:40.162
Oh, I know you did not. What, you have
a street appointment tonight, sister?

00:14:40.193 --> 00:14:42.341
Excuse me! Mr Maine, would you mind?

00:14:43.259 --> 00:14:45.240
Uh... What do you want me to do?

00:14:45.271 --> 00:14:47.242
Just come play a little song for me.

00:14:47.273 --> 00:14:49.337
- I don't know.
- Can you leave the man alone, please?

00:14:49.369 --> 00:14:52.215
I showed you mine, you show me yours.
Come on.

00:14:52.247 --> 00:14:56.209
He already signed your tits, honey.
Say, "No, sir."

00:14:56.240 --> 00:14:59.327
- Show off for me a little bit.
- Only because you already performed.

00:14:59.358 --> 00:15:01.213
You're so nice. Thank you.

00:15:01.244 --> 00:15:04.289
Lord, the man is here for Ally.
Not for you, sister.

00:15:05.373 --> 00:15:08.355
- Oh... She's nice. Yeah.
- Isn't it cute? Little arts and crafts.

00:15:08.387 --> 00:15:10.378
- Yeah, and light.
- Mm-hm.

00:15:10.410 --> 00:15:13.173
- Did you do this yourself?
- Yeah, all me.

00:15:13.204 --> 00:15:14.361
Looks great.

00:15:15.269 --> 00:15:18.261
Does this mic work?
Oh, yeah. Fuck, all right.

00:15:18.293 --> 00:15:19.419
What do you want me to play?

00:15:20.200 --> 00:15:22.191
I don't care,
just look at me while you do it.

00:15:22.223 --> 00:15:26.216
- Oh, Lord! Somebody kill me now.
- Let me see what I can... All right.

00:16:48.336 --> 00:16:49.462
You're ready?

00:16:49.493 --> 00:16:52.309
- You know I would!
- OK.

00:16:52.944 --> 00:16:54.049
- It's a cop bar.
- Cops?

00:16:54.081 --> 00:16:56.062
Yeah, that's why they serve
all night long.

00:17:02.902 --> 00:17:04.998
- Can I ask you a personal question?
- Oh. Sure.

00:17:05.029 --> 00:17:07.083
Do you write songs or anything?

00:17:08.929 --> 00:17:11.108
- I don't sing my own songs.
- Thank you.

00:17:12.973 --> 00:17:14.080
Why?

00:17:17.019 --> 00:17:20.012
I just... I just don't feel comfortable.

00:17:20.043 --> 00:17:22.055
Why wouldn't you feel comfortable?

00:17:22.983 --> 00:17:23.984
Um...

00:17:24.016 --> 00:17:26.987
Well, cos, like,
almost every single person

00:17:27.019 --> 00:17:29.125
that I've come in contact with
in the music industry

00:17:29.156 --> 00:17:32.149
has told me that my nose is too big
and that I won't make it.

00:17:32.930 --> 00:17:34.932
- Your nose is too big?
- Yeah.

00:17:35.119 --> 00:17:37.090
Your nose is beautiful.

00:17:37.997 --> 00:17:39.968
- Are you showing me your nose?
- Yeah.

00:17:39.999 --> 00:17:42.043
- I've been looking at it all night.
- Oh, come on.

00:17:42.074 --> 00:17:44.045
I'll be thinking about it
for a long time.

00:17:44.076 --> 00:17:46.120
- You're full of shit.
- I'm telling you the truth.

00:17:46.151 --> 00:17:48.143
- You're full of shit.
- Can I touch your nose?

00:17:48.174 --> 00:17:51.104
- Oh, my gosh!
- Let me just touch it for a second.

00:18:01.155 --> 00:18:03.167
- You're very lucky.
- Oh, really?

00:18:03.199 --> 00:18:05.169
- Mm-hm.
- Yeah, not really.

00:18:05.201 --> 00:18:07.130
My nose has not made me lucky.

00:18:08.058 --> 00:18:11.082
I could've had maybe a hit song
if it wasn't for my nose.

00:18:11.113 --> 00:18:13.030
- That's fucking bullshit.
- Yeah.

00:18:13.063 --> 00:18:15.158
No, it's not bullshit
because you go into these rooms

00:18:15.190 --> 00:18:17.159
and there's all these fucking men
in there

00:18:17.191 --> 00:18:20.204
and they're just staring at you,
listening to your record, going,

00:18:20.986 --> 00:18:24.041
"Oh, you sound great,
but you don't look so great."

00:18:24.073 --> 00:18:26.200
You know, I had a thing
when I was little...

00:18:26.982 --> 00:18:29.161
I was born with this thing in my ear.
Couldn't hear.

00:18:30.079 --> 00:18:32.997
What do I wind up being?
A singer. So, you never know.

00:18:33.175 --> 00:18:37.095
Look, talent comes everywhere.
Everybody's talented.

00:18:37.126 --> 00:18:39.180
Bet you fucking everybody
in this bar is talented

00:18:39.212 --> 00:18:43.018
in one thing or another,
but having something to say...

00:18:43.049 --> 00:18:46.115
and the way to say it so people
listen to it, that's a whole other bag.

00:18:46.146 --> 00:18:49.201
And unless you get out there
and you try to do it, you'll never know.

00:18:49.232 --> 00:18:51.088
That's just the truth.

00:18:51.120 --> 00:18:53.027
If there's one reason we're here,

00:18:53.059 --> 00:18:55.228
it's to say something
so people wanna hear it.

00:18:56.009 --> 00:18:59.022
- Understand what I'm trying to tell you?
- Yeah, I do.

00:18:59.054 --> 00:19:02.036
I don't like it, but I understand it.

00:19:02.067 --> 00:19:04.017
Oh, I think you like it a little bit.

00:19:04.225 --> 00:19:07.135
I think I'm getting through a little bit.
I can see it.

00:19:08.083 --> 00:19:09.209
No, you can't.

00:19:11.055 --> 00:19:12.265
It's a good thing we met.

00:19:14.057 --> 00:19:15.142
- Yeah.
- For both of us.

00:19:15.174 --> 00:19:17.164
- Trust me.
- I don't know what is going on.

00:19:17.196 --> 00:19:19.135
- Honestly, what...
- Who does?

00:19:19.166 --> 00:19:22.211
I'm in a cop bar, with Jackson Maine.
It's, like...

00:19:22.242 --> 00:19:25.079
- Jackson Maine!
- I'm gonna wake up in a minute.

00:19:25.110 --> 00:19:28.155
When you get famous,
people start saying your full name.

00:19:29.114 --> 00:19:31.116
- Well, what do you want...
- Just "Jack".

00:19:31.147 --> 00:19:33.076
Speaking of...

00:19:33.107 --> 00:19:34.119
Come on.

00:19:34.150 --> 00:19:36.141
- What?
- Did you put that on?

00:19:37.142 --> 00:19:41.052
You put that on.
When did you even go to the jukebox?

00:19:41.083 --> 00:19:42.168
Oh, God!

00:19:42.199 --> 00:19:45.098
I hear that song,
and I just wanna turn it the fuck off.

00:19:45.129 --> 00:19:47.068
- Jack Maine!
- I fucked that song up.

00:19:47.100 --> 00:19:49.195
- No! What? Come on.
- Oh, my God!

00:19:49.227 --> 00:19:52.073
Hey, I know that
we're not supposed to do this.

00:19:52.209 --> 00:19:54.284
I know that we're not supposed
to bother you.

00:19:55.065 --> 00:19:56.087
That's all right.

00:19:56.118 --> 00:19:59.100
You got your camera?
I don't have mine. Excuse me, one sec.

00:19:59.131 --> 00:20:01.175
- My ex-girlfriend was fucking this guy.
- OK.

00:20:01.206 --> 00:20:03.156
- Who looks like you, she said.
- Shut up.

00:20:03.188 --> 00:20:05.252
But I gotta take a picture of you
to send to her

00:20:05.283 --> 00:20:08.245
to show her that you look
nothing like that fucking guy.

00:20:08.276 --> 00:20:10.184
- Jack, I'm sorry.
- Take a picture.

00:20:10.215 --> 00:20:12.228
Will that help you?
Will that make you happy?

00:20:12.259 --> 00:20:14.324
- OK. Take a picture?
- Want someone to take the picture?

00:20:15.105 --> 00:20:16.168
- No. It's OK.
- Excuse me.

00:20:16.200 --> 00:20:18.306
- Get the fuck off, you little whore.
- What? What?

00:20:19.223 --> 00:20:21.236
- Hey, come on. Stand up, yeah.
- What?

00:20:23.154 --> 00:20:24.270
- I got you.
- I'm sorry, Jack!

00:20:24.301 --> 00:20:27.148
- It's all right.
- Oh, my God! Why did I...

00:20:30.245 --> 00:20:33.331
I'm fine, honestly. I'm OK.
This is so stupid.

00:20:34.112 --> 00:20:36.261
No, you gotta get ahead
of the swelling.

00:20:36.292 --> 00:20:38.200
Just trying to find some...

00:20:38.231 --> 00:20:40.254
- This is so embarrassing.
- ..peas.

00:20:41.317 --> 00:20:45.165
Here we go.
Yeah, put that on there.

00:20:45.196 --> 00:20:47.125
Gotta wrap something up with it.

00:20:47.157 --> 00:20:48.335
Find it.

00:20:49.304 --> 00:20:51.317
- You like Cheetos?
- No, like gauze.

00:20:51.348 --> 00:20:53.236
- Some gauze or something.
- Gauze?

00:20:53.267 --> 00:20:56.123
Try to do that. With that hand.

00:20:57.134 --> 00:20:58.323
And do that hand.

00:20:59.241 --> 00:21:00.367
You play piano?

00:21:02.202 --> 00:21:06.164
- Yeah, we gotta take care of this, then.
- Oh, OK. Thanks.

00:21:12.347 --> 00:21:15.172
And that's it, yeah.
Keep that on there. Hold on.

00:21:15.204 --> 00:21:17.311
Can you do that? Yeah.
Did you get it?

00:21:17.342 --> 00:21:19.301
It's already gotten warm, hasn't it?

00:21:19.332 --> 00:21:21.334
- Should we have gotten two?
- No, it's OK.

00:21:22.367 --> 00:21:24.254
Thanks.

00:21:24.285 --> 00:21:27.195
I'm sorry. I... I had to.

00:21:27.226 --> 00:21:28.352
That's all right.

00:21:30.260 --> 00:21:33.305
- It's not really all right, though.
- Have a good one.

00:21:33.336 --> 00:21:35.234
Be careful, she'll hit you.

00:21:37.361 --> 00:21:41.322
These rings are gonna get stuck
if you don't take them off.

00:21:42.396 --> 00:21:45.357
- Does that hurt?
- Yeah. That's OK.

00:21:45.389 --> 00:21:47.234
- May I?
- Yeah.

00:21:54.398 --> 00:21:56.316
Safekeeping.

00:21:58.255 --> 00:22:00.226
- Put this on there.
- You're a sweetheart.

00:22:00.257 --> 00:22:01.425
And we'll just wrap it up.

00:22:02.207 --> 00:22:03.406
You'll be good to go.

00:22:04.188 --> 00:22:06.305
How the hell
do you deal with that all the time?

00:22:06.336 --> 00:22:09.349
- What's that?
- People just...talking to you

00:22:09.380 --> 00:22:12.269
like you're not a real person,
or taking your picture.

00:22:12.300 --> 00:22:14.323
- Is that too tight?
- Ah, it's OK, thanks.

00:22:15.251 --> 00:22:17.388
- Whoo... That hurt you?
- That's fine, it's OK.

00:22:18.347 --> 00:22:19.443
There we go.

00:22:20.224 --> 00:22:22.288
Now you're mobile.
Swing it around.

00:22:22.445 --> 00:22:26.365
- I look like a pirate.
- Right?

00:22:26.396 --> 00:22:28.398
I told you it was worth coming here.

00:22:28.430 --> 00:22:30.338
How do you do that?

00:22:30.369 --> 00:22:32.423
- Do what?
- Don't change the subject.

00:22:32.455 --> 00:22:36.354
- Is that what I'm doing?
- Nobody ever asks you about you, huh?

00:22:36.386 --> 00:22:39.408
- Not sure.
- Where are you from?

00:22:39.441 --> 00:22:41.265
Arizona.

00:22:43.308 --> 00:22:45.258
- Arizona boy.
- Mm-hm.

00:22:45.289 --> 00:22:48.240
Dad had, like, a midlife crisis, I think.

00:22:48.272 --> 00:22:50.284
So I've been told.

00:22:50.315 --> 00:22:55.362
Made his way to Arizona, started working
for this family on a pecan ranch.

00:22:56.290 --> 00:22:57.416
- A pecan ranch?
- Yeah.

00:22:59.449 --> 00:23:03.484
Knocked up the family's daughter.
She was just shy of 18.

00:23:04.266 --> 00:23:06.330
Uh-oh.

00:23:06.362 --> 00:23:08.301
That's when I came into the picture.

00:23:08.332 --> 00:23:10.334
- OK. The son of an 18-year-old.
- Yeah.

00:23:10.366 --> 00:23:13.337
Well, she died at childbirth.

00:23:14.359 --> 00:23:16.382
- Then, my dad...
- I'm sorry.

00:23:16.413 --> 00:23:18.320
He...

00:23:18.488 --> 00:23:21.355
He died when I was 13, so I guess...

00:23:21.386 --> 00:23:24.389
my brother would tell you
that he raised me, but...

00:23:25.452 --> 00:23:28.299
..I don't know.
I don't know who was raising who.

00:23:28.330 --> 00:23:33.377
Just 127 acres of nuts, Navajo,
and nowhere to go.

00:24:09.453 --> 00:24:10.537
Is that me?

00:24:11.319 --> 00:24:12.456
That's you.

00:24:13.509 --> 00:24:16.345
- Did you just write that now?
- Yeah.

00:24:17.357 --> 00:24:18.524
It's pretty good.

00:24:51.576 --> 00:24:56.519
I started writing this song
the other day, and...

00:25:01.564 --> 00:25:05.506
..maybe that could work,
like as a chorus or something.

00:25:07.456 --> 00:25:09.562
I have to think if I can remember it.
Ah...

00:25:45.638 --> 00:25:47.546
Holy shit.

00:25:50.538 --> 00:25:52.415
What is this?

00:25:53.562 --> 00:25:55.564
Was this supposed to help me?

00:26:04.531 --> 00:26:05.657
Can I tell you a secret?

00:26:10.516 --> 00:26:13.446
I think you might be a songwriter.

00:26:18.524 --> 00:26:20.661
But don't worry, I won't tell anybody.

00:26:24.550 --> 00:26:26.552
But I'm not very good
at keeping secrets.

00:26:33.642 --> 00:26:35.654
You're a real gentleman.

00:26:37.552 --> 00:26:39.459
I think.

00:26:51.492 --> 00:26:52.629
Thank you, sir.
It's on the right.

00:26:52.660 --> 00:26:54.516
- Right there?
- Which one?

00:26:54.547 --> 00:26:55.684
- This one.
- Oh, yeah.

00:26:56.466 --> 00:26:59.542
- What's all this?
- Oh, it's my dad.

00:26:59.573 --> 00:27:01.595
It's a long story.

00:27:01.627 --> 00:27:03.555
What's he, a sheikh?

00:27:05.495 --> 00:27:06.631
No, he's a driver.

00:27:07.601 --> 00:27:10.687
Hey, I got a gig.
You wanna come?

00:27:11.709 --> 00:27:14.483
- When?
- We're headed to the airport now.

00:27:14.514 --> 00:27:16.600
- Tonight.
- Tonight? No, I can't.

00:27:16.631 --> 00:27:19.644
I gotta go to work later.
I gotta go to bed.

00:27:19.675 --> 00:27:22.605
Who's gonna take care of your hand?
I messed it up.

00:27:22.636 --> 00:27:24.492
- Me.
- No, no!

00:27:24.523 --> 00:27:25.701
- I'll take care of it.
- It's my fault.

00:27:25.733 --> 00:27:28.642
- That's OK.
- No, listen. Hey!

00:27:30.581 --> 00:27:33.616
- You have my number.
- OK. All right.

00:27:38.568 --> 00:27:40.643
- Hey.
- What?

00:27:41.676 --> 00:27:44.532
I just wanted to take
another look at you.

00:28:06.699 --> 00:28:08.721
Maybe I fucked that up.

00:28:09.660 --> 00:28:10.713
No.

00:28:11.756 --> 00:28:13.779
- Hi, Dad.
- Pretty late, pretty late.

00:28:14.561 --> 00:28:15.666
- Oh? Is it late?
- Yeah.

00:28:15.697 --> 00:28:18.575
Look at you. You don't even know
where you're walking.

00:28:18.773 --> 00:28:20.702
- Come on.
- Well, I wanna go to bed.

00:28:20.733 --> 00:28:24.747
No, come in for two minutes.
It's Wolfie's birthday. Come on.

00:28:25.790 --> 00:28:27.667
- Two minutes!
- OK.

00:28:27.698 --> 00:28:29.596
- Wolfie!
- Yeah, sweetheart?

00:28:29.627 --> 00:28:31.796
- Who was the guy in the car?
- I don't know what you're talking about.

00:28:32.578 --> 00:28:33.693
- Hey, Ally.
- How's it goin'?

00:28:33.725 --> 00:28:35.800
- Happy birthday.
- "Happy birthday"?

00:28:36.582 --> 00:28:37.687
- Yeah.
- It's not my birthday.

00:28:37.718 --> 00:28:39.804
- What do you mean? Come on.
- No, I was just saying...

00:28:40.585 --> 00:28:42.754
What the hell happened in here?
My God!

00:28:42.786 --> 00:28:45.798
- This place is a mess!
- "Starting gate" is "shuppatsu geto",

00:28:46.580 --> 00:28:49.688
- and "bad beat" is "warui bito".
- What's going on? Leave the butter out?

00:28:49.719 --> 00:28:52.732
Who the hell's betting on horses
at breakfast time in Japan?

00:28:52.763 --> 00:28:54.703
- It's not breakfast time.
- They're loading!

00:28:54.734 --> 00:28:55.798
- Joe, come on!
- You're crazy!

00:28:56.580 --> 00:28:57.779
Have a sizable investment on this.

00:28:57.810 --> 00:28:59.802
What did I say
about smoking in this house?

00:29:00.583 --> 00:29:01.752
- Outside!
- Who are you?

00:29:01.783 --> 00:29:03.764
- It's my house.
- I know it's your house.

00:29:03.795 --> 00:29:06.620
- But you smoke too.
- All right, forget it.

00:29:06.651 --> 00:29:09.623
Sweetheart, you're happy here,
aren't you?

00:29:09.654 --> 00:29:10.676
I'm happy, Dad.

00:29:10.708 --> 00:29:12.803
I'm just saying, she's got no space.

00:29:12.835 --> 00:29:14.691
- What are you saying?
- Sweetheart.

00:29:14.722 --> 00:29:15.838
- She's got no space.
- Wait a minute.

00:29:16.620 --> 00:29:18.726
I want my friends to look at you.

00:29:18.757 --> 00:29:20.759
Take a good look.

00:29:20.790 --> 00:29:24.637
With a voice like from heaven,
but you know what?

00:29:27.651 --> 00:29:29.684
It's not always the best singers
that make it.

00:29:30.622 --> 00:29:35.784
You know? I knew a couple of guys
could sing Sinatra under the table.

00:29:35.815 --> 00:29:38.735
But Frank, he'd come on stage
with the blue eyes,

00:29:38.766 --> 00:29:42.644
the sharkskin suit,
the patent leather shoes...

00:29:42.675 --> 00:29:43.854
he becomes Frank Sinatra.

00:29:44.855 --> 00:29:48.775
And everybody else,
all these other guys...

00:29:48.806 --> 00:29:52.664
that really got it,
that really have it inside...

00:29:53.759 --> 00:29:55.719
..just a bunch of nobodies.

00:29:56.762 --> 00:29:58.879
OK. Everybody, let's go.

00:29:59.661 --> 00:30:00.714
Time for work.

00:30:12.735 --> 00:30:14.810
Unfortunately,
you keep blasting the hearing...

00:30:14.841 --> 00:30:16.677
it's not gonna come back.

00:30:16.708 --> 00:30:18.856
I think it's time we reconsider
the in-ear monitors.

00:30:18.887 --> 00:30:21.859
We talked about that with Bobby
a couple of weeks ago.

00:30:21.890 --> 00:30:24.705
If we put the in-ear molds in,
we can use those

00:30:24.736 --> 00:30:25.872
to amplify the high frequencies.

00:30:25.905 --> 00:30:27.781
- OK, great.
- Cut down the sound.

00:30:27.812 --> 00:30:29.699
- Yeah.
- I'm gonna talk to Bobby

00:30:29.730 --> 00:30:31.732
- and get something set up.
- Sold. I'm sold.

00:30:31.764 --> 00:30:33.745
- All right, Jack.
- Yeah, call Bobby.

00:30:33.859 --> 00:30:36.883
- Stubborn son of a bitch.
<i>- Ready. One, two, three, four.</i>

00:30:55.933 --> 00:30:59.739
- We're trying...
- You gotta put 'em in, man.

00:31:03.721 --> 00:31:04.826
I told you, I can't wear those.

00:31:04.858 --> 00:31:07.850
When I wear 'em, it's just in my head,
and I need to be here.

00:31:07.881 --> 00:31:11.739
The doctor said it's the only way
to manage this thing, Jack.

00:31:11.916 --> 00:31:13.950
You're not gonna get back what you lost.

00:31:14.732 --> 00:31:16.796
It's the only way we can manage
what you still got.

00:31:16.828 --> 00:31:18.819
Oh, wow. Ha!

00:31:18.850 --> 00:31:20.863
I think we're managing pretty good.

00:31:20.894 --> 00:31:22.875
What do you want me to do?

00:31:26.816 --> 00:31:30.788
- The door's wide open if you wanna go.
- You know what? Don't start that shit.

00:31:33.729 --> 00:31:35.898
Show a little fucking pride
in what you're doing, buddy.

00:31:35.929 --> 00:31:39.745
I just wanna know
if she's on her way or not, that's all.

00:31:39.777 --> 00:31:41.768
Who's coming?

00:31:42.821 --> 00:31:43.926
What the fuck?

00:31:43.958 --> 00:31:45.865
Who's here?

00:31:45.896 --> 00:31:48.753
I have no idea. He won't tell me.

00:31:50.828 --> 00:31:51.986
- Hi, Ally. I'm Phil.
- Hi.

00:31:52.768 --> 00:31:53.810
- We met last night.
- Yeah.

00:31:53.842 --> 00:31:56.876
- Jack sent me to take you to the gig.
- Oh, my God.

00:31:56.907 --> 00:31:58.993
Um... But I gotta work.

00:31:59.775 --> 00:32:01.881
- I can't go.
- He's really looking forward to this.

00:32:01.912 --> 00:32:03.767
I appreciate that, but...

00:32:03.799 --> 00:32:06.812
I can't leave, so I'll be in my car
right down the street.

00:32:06.843 --> 00:32:09.763
Tell him, "Thank you, but no, thank you."
Say it like that.

00:32:09.794 --> 00:32:12.870
- Wait, Ally. What are you doing?
- The fuck is that shit? This is crazy.

00:32:12.901 --> 00:32:14.914
- This is great.
- What the hell's going on?

00:32:14.945 --> 00:32:17.906
Look, a guy like that
invites you to a show...

00:32:17.938 --> 00:32:20.889
- It could be a great opportunity.
- Dad, don't start with me!

00:32:20.920 --> 00:32:23.923
Listen. Does he know you sing at all?
Did he hear anything from you?

00:32:23.954 --> 00:32:26.852
- I gotta go to work.
- It's the opportunity of a lifetime.

00:32:26.883 --> 00:32:28.823
I don't have the same disease you have.

00:32:28.854 --> 00:32:31.836
You get around celebrities
like they're gonna rub off on you.

00:32:31.867 --> 00:32:34.026
- What are you talking about?
- "Oh, you know who I drove?"

00:32:34.808 --> 00:32:36.831
Like magic, now you're famous.

00:32:36.862 --> 00:32:39.823
- And you're not. It's not magic, Dad.
- Sweetheart.

00:32:39.854 --> 00:32:41.919
He's a drunk!
You know all about drunks.

00:32:50.969 --> 00:32:52.908
Sweetheart, he's still there.

00:32:54.033 --> 00:32:55.076
You fucking hit a cop?

00:32:55.107 --> 00:32:59.153
Yeah, he was being an asshole to Jack,
so I fucking popped him in the face.

00:32:59.184 --> 00:33:00.999
That is so gangster!

00:33:01.030 --> 00:33:04.064
Then we ended up in a parking lot
and he put peas around my hand to fix it.

00:33:04.096 --> 00:33:07.088
Then he was singing and I was singing.
I don't know what's going on.

00:33:07.119 --> 00:33:09.111
Now he's got his driver
following me around.

00:33:09.142 --> 00:33:11.174
He's been following you
from your house to work?

00:33:11.207 --> 00:33:13.135
- Yes. It's crazy!
- You're fucking late.

00:33:13.166 --> 00:33:14.991
I'm what?

00:33:15.022 --> 00:33:16.169
I said you're late!

00:33:25.136 --> 00:33:27.045
Are we doing this?

00:33:32.153 --> 00:33:34.030
Hey, Bryan, I'm out.

00:33:34.061 --> 00:33:36.073
- Find somebody else.
- Bryan, I'll be back.

00:33:36.105 --> 00:33:38.044
- Papo, I promise.
- See ya. I won't.

00:33:40.182 --> 00:33:44.019
- Did you see Bryan's face?
- Hey, great! Let's do this.

00:33:44.196 --> 00:33:46.052
Let's go.

00:33:47.022 --> 00:33:48.231
What are we doing?

00:33:49.149 --> 00:33:53.069
You know, if I didn't know Jack...
I would call you a stalker.

00:33:53.100 --> 00:33:56.186
Yeah, sorry about that.

00:33:58.094 --> 00:34:00.201
Yes, man!

00:34:04.194 --> 00:34:07.166
Lay on that couch right now!
I'm gonna take my shoes off.

00:34:07.197 --> 00:34:08.282
- Oh, my God!
- This is nice.

00:34:09.063 --> 00:34:10.190
How this shit works?

00:34:10.221 --> 00:34:12.243
- They just told you no.
- Oh, OK. I'm so sorry.

00:34:12.275 --> 00:34:14.109
Oh, shit!

00:34:17.185 --> 00:34:18.291
I could get used to this shit.

00:34:19.073 --> 00:34:21.200
You need to date more rock stars,
baby girl, you know?

00:34:21.231 --> 00:34:22.295
We're not dating.

00:34:33.221 --> 00:34:34.264
Hi, Ally. I'm Gail.

00:34:35.192 --> 00:34:36.235
<i>- Hi.</i>
<i>- Hi.</i>

00:34:36.266 --> 00:34:38.216
Leave your bags.
We'll grab 'em in a sec.

00:34:38.247 --> 00:34:39.300
- Ready?
- OK, sure.

00:34:40.082 --> 00:34:41.229
- OK. Yeah.
- Thanks.

00:34:46.182 --> 00:34:48.299
- Did you have a good trip?
- Yeah.

00:34:51.217 --> 00:34:52.260
Passes.

00:34:52.292 --> 00:34:54.231
- Thank you.
- Put 'em around your necks.

00:34:54.262 --> 00:34:57.098
Ear plugs. You'll need these.
It's loud up there.

00:34:58.276 --> 00:35:00.133
Yeah, I got 'em.
We're coming in.

00:35:00.164 --> 00:35:02.124
I'll bring you guys to the side stage.

00:35:06.264 --> 00:35:08.214
Guys, guys, guys. This way.
Wrong way.

00:35:08.245 --> 00:35:12.144
- Sorry. This place is so big. I'm just...
- Come on, this way.

00:35:12.311 --> 00:35:14.219
Oh, watch yourself.

00:35:16.116 --> 00:35:17.180
You guys good?

00:35:18.348 --> 00:35:20.297
Hey, boys.

00:35:21.257 --> 00:35:23.238
He's so excited that you're here.

00:37:26.449 --> 00:37:28.430
Thank you very much.

00:37:29.337 --> 00:37:31.244
That was great.

00:37:33.319 --> 00:37:35.446
There's a friend of mine
who came a long way to be here

00:37:35.478 --> 00:37:38.324
and she wrote a great song,
and I'd like her to sing it.

00:37:38.356 --> 00:37:40.305
I think it's pretty fucking good.

00:37:47.385 --> 00:37:49.252
- How are you?
- I'm good. Hi!

00:37:49.283 --> 00:37:50.440
- It's so good to see you.
- How are you?

00:37:50.472 --> 00:37:52.390
- You were so good.
- The trip was fine?

00:37:52.422 --> 00:37:54.339
- Yeah.
- Phil didn't bother you?

00:37:54.371 --> 00:37:55.476
Gail was so nice.

00:37:56.258 --> 00:37:58.375
So, listen, we're gonna
sing that song, all right?

00:37:58.406 --> 00:38:00.397
I did an arrangement -
kind of not so great -

00:38:00.429 --> 00:38:02.285
- but stick with it.
- No, I can't.

00:38:02.316 --> 00:38:03.463
- I'm sorry.
- Yeah, you're coming.

00:38:03.494 --> 00:38:06.435
Please. It's not funny.
Jack, don't fuck around.

00:38:07.467 --> 00:38:09.500
All you gotta do is trust me.

00:38:10.376 --> 00:38:12.304
That's all you gotta do.

00:38:14.410 --> 00:38:16.423
I'm gonna sing it either way, so...

00:38:27.507 --> 00:38:31.344
- Steve...
- "Trust me." OK.

00:38:32.323 --> 00:38:34.388
- You have to go sing.
- I'm not going out there, no.

00:42:04.577 --> 00:42:07.528
- Oh, my God! There's so many people.
- Pretty fucking good, man.

00:42:07.559 --> 00:42:08.602
Pretty fucking good.

00:42:08.633 --> 00:42:10.531
The way the guitar started...

00:42:10.562 --> 00:42:13.545
I thought maybe I set it in the wrong key,
and the tempo was too fast.

00:42:13.576 --> 00:42:15.713
- No, it was so beautiful, and...
- I wasn't sure...

00:42:15.745 --> 00:42:17.631
- Ally, you OK?
- Jack?

00:42:19.602 --> 00:42:20.749
Jack?

00:42:22.511 --> 00:42:23.720
You. You, move!

00:42:25.639 --> 00:42:28.538
- Isn't that the girl who sang?
- Good concert, man!

00:42:28.569 --> 00:42:29.737
- Thank you, yeah.
- Love you, man.

00:42:30.519 --> 00:42:33.564
- Thank you.
- Hey, Jack. Killed it.

00:42:33.595 --> 00:42:34.742
- Really?
- Yeah.

00:42:42.738 --> 00:42:45.627
Hi! Oh, my God!

00:42:45.658 --> 00:42:47.670
Where's my key?
I don't fucking...

00:42:48.744 --> 00:42:50.705
Ah! Ha-ha-ha.

00:42:52.634 --> 00:42:53.781
Oh, fuck!

00:43:10.640 --> 00:43:13.612
I'll be right back. OK?
Just give me one second.

00:43:17.625 --> 00:43:20.587
Is this the bathroom?
Where's the fucking...

00:43:20.618 --> 00:43:21.702
OK.

00:43:50.605 --> 00:43:51.731
Hey.

00:43:53.629 --> 00:43:54.661
Jack?

00:43:54.693 --> 00:43:56.621
I don't know, wake him up.

00:43:56.652 --> 00:43:58.696
- I can't wake him up. He's drunk.
- Yes, you can!

00:43:58.727 --> 00:44:01.772
Shake your titties in his face
or some shit, and just fucking...

00:44:01.803 --> 00:44:03.711
Know what I'm saying?
Take two shots.

00:44:03.742 --> 00:44:05.838
Thank you so much for your help.
You are so helpful.

00:44:06.620 --> 00:44:07.778
Let me know how it goes, baby.

00:44:15.859 --> 00:44:17.819
Come on, pal.

00:44:25.722 --> 00:44:26.848
He's out.

00:44:29.747 --> 00:44:32.656
You think maybe he drinks
a bit much?

00:44:35.878 --> 00:44:38.661
Sweetie, you have no idea.

00:44:39.756 --> 00:44:41.664
Tell you one thing, though.

00:44:41.695 --> 00:44:43.864
He's never brought a girl
on stage before.

00:44:46.690 --> 00:44:49.807
And it's been a long, long time
since he played like that.

00:44:50.725 --> 00:44:52.706
Well, that's good to know.

00:45:56.757 --> 00:45:57.956
One time, my brother came home,

00:45:58.737 --> 00:46:01.719
I was playing on this upright
we used to always have in our den.

00:46:01.750 --> 00:46:02.866
And I was, like, in my own world.

00:46:02.897 --> 00:46:04.920
No-one was ever home,
and then he comes home

00:46:04.951 --> 00:46:06.859
to take care of my dad,
who was sick.

00:46:07.860 --> 00:46:09.946
And he's sittin' there,
and he's looking at me.

00:46:10.728 --> 00:46:13.887
I swear to God, he looked at me
like I was special or something,

00:46:13.918 --> 00:46:15.931
and it just kind of filled me up.

00:46:15.962 --> 00:46:18.745
I should've never told you that.
I don't know.

00:46:18.777 --> 00:46:19.830
Why?

00:46:19.862 --> 00:46:21.936
- Cos it's embarrassing.
- It's so sweet.

00:46:21.968 --> 00:46:24.803
Cos you're nothing like my brother,
let me just say.

00:46:24.835 --> 00:46:28.745
- Yeah, I don't look like your brother?
- He's a fucking old man, OK.

00:46:28.943 --> 00:46:30.976
My dad had me
when he was 63 years old.

00:46:31.758 --> 00:46:32.832
63 years old?

00:46:32.864 --> 00:46:35.835
- And we have different mothers, so...
- Huh.

00:46:37.753 --> 00:46:39.776
What's that number down here?

00:46:40.777 --> 00:46:42.831
That is how many people looked at it.

00:46:42.862 --> 00:46:45.876
Get the fuck out of here. How do
they know how many people looked at it?

00:46:45.907 --> 00:46:48.764
I think it's...
They call it an algorithm, or...

00:46:48.795 --> 00:46:49.890
What's an algorithm?

00:46:49.921 --> 00:46:51.777
It's like a beat.

00:46:51.809 --> 00:46:53.915
- A beat?
- Yeah. Yeah.

00:46:53.946 --> 00:46:55.833
- Like in music, a beat?
- Yeah.

00:46:55.865 --> 00:46:58.804
Yeah, yeah. I think, I don't know.

00:46:58.993 --> 00:47:01.005
- Do you believe this?
- No.

00:47:03.934 --> 00:47:05.853
- Wow.
- And you see this?

00:47:05.884 --> 00:47:07.824
- Yeah.
- That's how many people have watched.

00:47:07.855 --> 00:47:09.878
- Yeah, we're just telling...
- They was telling him.

00:47:09.909 --> 00:47:12.881
- How the fuck do they do that?
- I've watched it 200 times myself.

00:47:12.912 --> 00:47:15.894
- I'm 200 of those people.
- Go, Pops.

00:47:17.907 --> 00:47:22.806
Oh, jeez!
My God, you're so fast! Jack!

00:47:22.838 --> 00:47:24.881
French toast is gonna come out.

00:47:28.927 --> 00:47:30.877
First one to hit the bed.

00:47:41.845 --> 00:47:46.058
- Beautiful. You wrote this with him?
- He's so talented.

00:47:46.840 --> 00:47:48.956
- Can I watch it again?
- Yeah, it's good. One more time.

00:47:48.988 --> 00:47:51.886
- I'll be up all night watching this.
- Or 500. Come on!

00:47:52.981 --> 00:47:54.983
Christ!

00:48:13.907 --> 00:48:15.951
Oh, my God.

00:48:16.879 --> 00:48:18.047
How did you get in here?

00:48:18.078 --> 00:48:19.997
Your dad let me in.

00:48:34.051 --> 00:48:35.866
What?

00:48:41.954 --> 00:48:43.998
<i>I don't feel this way about everybody.</i>

00:48:44.029 --> 00:48:48.106
Well, good. Then we're on the same page.
You come and sing with me.

00:48:49.952 --> 00:48:51.891
Where?

00:48:51.923 --> 00:48:54.060
Well, first stop's Arizona.

00:49:00.076 --> 00:49:03.058
I'm never getting on that thing with you
when you've been drinking.

00:49:03.090 --> 00:49:06.134
I haven't even thought about drinking
or anything else.

00:49:06.916 --> 00:49:09.126
We'll see how long that lasts.
Go wait downstairs.

00:49:11.983 --> 00:49:15.977
Actually, when I was in my 20's and 30's,
I was like a crooner.

00:49:16.008 --> 00:49:18.928
As a matter of fact,
a lot of people thought I was...

00:49:18.959 --> 00:49:20.918
better than Sinatra.

00:49:20.950 --> 00:49:23.066
Frank Sinatra?

00:49:33.045 --> 00:49:34.964
What are you writing down in here?

00:49:34.995 --> 00:49:37.977
That's my songbook.
I usually use a typewriter, but...

00:49:38.008 --> 00:49:40.114
I had this idea on the bike...

00:49:40.146 --> 00:49:42.096
and I didn't wanna forget it.

00:49:43.033 --> 00:49:46.036
How do you hear it?

00:49:57.944 --> 00:50:01.968
Aren't you excited to be home
and play for all your Arizonian fans?

00:50:01.999 --> 00:50:03.178
I don't really come back here.

00:50:04.105 --> 00:50:06.983
- You avoid your home?
- I don't know.

00:50:08.068 --> 00:50:10.007
It's like the hot air and...

00:50:14.021 --> 00:50:16.013
..the history, I don't know.

00:50:16.962 --> 00:50:20.121
Bought the ranch, though, I grew up on.
Gave it to my brother.

00:50:21.966 --> 00:50:24.990
We buried Dad there, and so I wanted
to make sure that nobody...

00:50:25.021 --> 00:50:27.023
paved over his grave or...

00:50:27.054 --> 00:50:29.067
- any of that kind of shit.
- Is it around here?

00:50:29.098 --> 00:50:30.975
It's not far.

00:50:31.006 --> 00:50:33.071
Why don't we just go there?
It's nearby.

00:50:34.030 --> 00:50:35.187
Mm. Mm.

00:50:36.084 --> 00:50:37.189
Mm.

00:50:45.208 --> 00:50:47.188
Jack?

00:50:56.051 --> 00:50:57.125
Yeah, if he shows up!

00:50:57.156 --> 00:51:00.149
These guys have been vamping out there
for a fucking half an hour.

00:51:00.180 --> 00:51:02.151
It's time to fucking get on.

00:51:02.182 --> 00:51:04.141
Don't you get tired of being...

00:51:06.102 --> 00:51:08.041
You sold Dad's ranch!

00:51:08.229 --> 00:51:11.253
They turned it into a fucking wind farm!

00:51:15.225 --> 00:51:17.196
I bought that for you.

00:51:21.054 --> 00:51:22.201
Where's his grave?

00:51:22.232 --> 00:51:25.141
He washed away in a fucking storm.

00:51:25.172 --> 00:51:27.226
His grave isn't there any more.

00:51:29.092 --> 00:51:31.251
I told you, but you were fucking drunk.

00:51:32.033 --> 00:51:33.263
You were fucking loaded...

00:51:34.045 --> 00:51:36.245
and already pissing yourself
a swan song.

00:51:39.155 --> 00:51:41.146
Fuck if you shed a tear
for that piece of shit

00:51:41.177 --> 00:51:44.159
you idolise for
no goddamn fucking reason.

00:51:47.266 --> 00:51:50.112
All Dad ever did for you...

00:51:52.062 --> 00:51:54.169
..was make you
his fucking drinking buddy.

00:51:55.149 --> 00:51:59.111
And you'd be right there with him if he
was still alive and you fucking know it.

00:52:02.124 --> 00:52:03.271
What did you think...

00:52:03.303 --> 00:52:06.159
that I was gonna
fucking take care of it...

00:52:07.076 --> 00:52:11.112
..while I'm fucking cradling your ass
all over the goddamn world?

00:52:17.170 --> 00:52:18.223
Yeah.

00:52:20.256 --> 00:52:23.123
That's a good excuse.
Raising a little brother

00:52:23.155 --> 00:52:26.178
so you don't have to deal with the fact
that you were no fucking good.

00:52:27.179 --> 00:52:30.130
If I was no good,
why'd you steal my fucking voice?

00:52:32.184 --> 00:52:35.176
- Huh?
- Cos you had nothing to fucking say.

00:52:40.181 --> 00:52:43.216
You were too proud to sing
any of the songs I ever wrote.

00:52:46.249 --> 00:52:48.261
Well, I got something to say now, pal.

00:52:48.292 --> 00:52:51.191
I'm done being your fucking errand boy.

00:52:53.329 --> 00:52:55.185
I quit.

00:53:01.639 --> 00:53:04.642
Yeah, my voice just got up on me
a few months ago and...

00:53:04.820 --> 00:53:07.812
..another shot of steroids
is better safe than sorry.

00:53:08.594 --> 00:53:11.774
Thank you for that. We should be good.

00:53:27.727 --> 00:53:28.811
Hey.

00:53:30.792 --> 00:53:33.649
- You OK?
- Yeah.

00:53:35.609 --> 00:53:37.663
Well, let's play.

00:55:48.861 --> 00:55:50.800
All right, I got an idea for the end.

00:55:50.832 --> 00:55:51.843
- Sorry...
- That's OK.

00:55:51.874 --> 00:55:54.867
- It's gonna be a little different...
- Cheers. Where's that joint?

00:55:54.898 --> 00:55:57.879
We're gonna be a little different
for the end, OK?

00:55:57.911 --> 00:56:00.778
- Do the encore and the thing that I said.
- OK.

00:56:00.809 --> 00:56:02.853
All right?
Come on, let's go back out and do it.

00:56:02.884 --> 00:56:05.804
- What are you doing?
- Go, go, go.

00:56:07.816 --> 00:56:09.912
All right, listen to me.
Here's what we're gonna do.

00:56:09.943 --> 00:56:12.780
You're gonna do the song
that I said I wanted you to do.

00:56:12.811 --> 00:56:13.927
- The one that I love.
- No. I'm not.

00:56:13.958 --> 00:56:15.991
- Please!
- Do the one that I love. It'll be great.

00:56:16.772 --> 00:56:17.951
- Jack, please...
- I said I always...

00:56:17.983 --> 00:56:20.870
- You promised to do it. I love you.
- I always say...

00:56:22.851 --> 00:56:24.885
Always remember us this way.

00:56:29.962 --> 00:56:33.810
Everybody, we're gonna
bring out Ally to bring us home...

00:56:33.841 --> 00:56:35.948
and she's gonna sing an original song.

00:56:36.959 --> 00:56:38.804
Thank you.

01:00:05.041 --> 01:00:09.108
Ally! Ally! Ally! Ally!

01:00:16.991 --> 01:00:19.222
That was fucking beautiful.

01:00:20.192 --> 01:00:23.100
No, you were fucking doing it.
I was there, I fucking...

01:00:23.131 --> 01:00:26.009
- Our car's over there.
- Ally, that was unbelievable.

01:00:26.041 --> 01:00:28.136
- Thank you.
- That was unbelievable what you did.

01:00:28.168 --> 01:00:29.200
Thank you.

01:00:29.231 --> 01:00:32.203
I don't know if you know about me,
about where I've come from.

01:00:32.234 --> 01:00:34.247
I'm Rez Gavron.

01:00:35.029 --> 01:00:37.208
I know who you are.

01:00:37.239 --> 01:00:42.087
What you have right now
goes way beyond just this.

01:00:44.037 --> 01:00:47.196
There's people who need to hear
what you have to say musically.

01:00:48.114 --> 01:00:52.045
This is not normal stuff.
It's really amazing what you're doing.

01:00:52.076 --> 01:00:54.224
I think you have it all. I do.

01:00:54.255 --> 01:00:57.112
And the question to you is,
"What do you want?"

01:00:58.186 --> 01:01:01.189
I'm in that position,
to put you wherever you want to be.

01:01:01.220 --> 01:01:04.254
I... I don't... I don't have...

01:01:07.246 --> 01:01:09.280
I gotta talk to Jack.

01:01:10.062 --> 01:01:13.263
He said that he thought Interscope
Records might really wanna sign me.

01:01:14.045 --> 01:01:16.234
And he said that he has
this wonderful studio

01:01:16.266 --> 01:01:18.153
with a beautiful live room

01:01:18.184 --> 01:01:20.270
and these amazing producers
he wants to bring in

01:01:21.051 --> 01:01:22.261
to record my songs.

01:01:23.188 --> 01:01:25.138
And he loves Look What I've Found.

01:01:25.170 --> 01:01:27.203
Remember the song we did in the diner?

01:01:27.234 --> 01:01:29.299
- Remember, when we were driving?
- Yeah.

01:01:31.082 --> 01:01:32.166
Yeah?

01:01:32.197 --> 01:01:37.098
I mean, it was so nice talking to him,
and he really believes in me.

01:01:38.255 --> 01:01:40.257
- You all right, Jack?
- He's OK. He's fine.

01:01:40.289 --> 01:01:42.165
He does this all the time.

01:01:43.270 --> 01:01:45.168
Hey, Jack.

01:01:50.246 --> 01:01:52.206
Thanks.

01:01:53.207 --> 01:01:56.210
What's going on? Hm?

01:01:58.202 --> 01:02:00.088
What are you doing?

01:02:04.269 --> 01:02:05.301
Oh.

01:02:10.171 --> 01:02:12.246
You jealous fuck.

01:02:15.113 --> 01:02:16.271
I'm so happy for you.

01:02:16.302 --> 01:02:18.293
Oh, you are?

01:02:18.325 --> 01:02:21.170
Oh... Jackson!

01:02:22.244 --> 01:02:24.330
Oh, my God!

01:02:26.238 --> 01:02:28.292
Jack. Stop!

01:02:31.118 --> 01:02:33.172
Why are you so jealous, boy?

01:02:33.203 --> 01:02:34.329
Hm?

01:02:36.144 --> 01:02:37.332
What are you doing?

01:02:37.364 --> 01:02:40.147
What's wrong? You upset?

01:02:42.264 --> 01:02:44.182
You want me to make you less...

01:02:45.131 --> 01:02:47.279
I know, do you wanna play?
OK, let's play.

01:02:50.323 --> 01:02:52.357
What the hell is this?

01:02:53.139 --> 01:02:54.286
- I'm so sorry.
<i>- No, you're fine.</i>

01:02:54.317 --> 01:02:57.185
<i>- You sound great, OK?</i>
<i>- You're doing great.</i>

01:02:57.216 --> 01:02:59.187
<i>We'll do it again.</i>
<i>I'm gonna cue you in.</i>

01:03:04.264 --> 01:03:07.183
<i>One second. Listen to my cue.</i>
<i>We'll come right in, OK?</i>

01:03:07.214 --> 01:03:09.321
<i>So, should... Well...</i>

01:03:10.207 --> 01:03:12.313
<i>I'm sorry,</i>
<i>but will I sing in the beginning?</i>

01:03:12.344 --> 01:03:16.203
You're gonna hear the second line,
and then I wanna start recording.

01:03:16.234 --> 01:03:19.195
I think I got an idea
that might help out, all right?

01:03:19.226 --> 01:03:22.187
- Please. Be my guest.
- That was really good up to that point.

01:03:22.218 --> 01:03:24.398
- I'm gonna go in there for a second.
- All right, Jack.

01:03:26.253 --> 01:03:29.256
- I've never sang with a track before.
- I think you need your piano.

01:03:29.288 --> 01:03:32.416
- If you're playing it and singing it...
- Yeah, I always play it on the piano.

01:03:33.198 --> 01:03:35.304
I'm gonna have them fly one in,
and we'll try it there

01:03:35.335 --> 01:03:37.358
- and see where it goes.
- You think that's OK?

01:03:38.349 --> 01:03:40.403
- OK. Thank you.
- I got you. You're doing great.

01:03:41.184 --> 01:03:42.321
- You OK?
- No, I'm so nervous.

01:03:42.353 --> 01:03:44.396
- You look so beautiful.
- Thank you.

01:03:45.417 --> 01:03:47.221
Thank you.

01:04:29.334 --> 01:04:32.275
Oh, so you guys have already met
the new girl, have you?

01:04:33.286 --> 01:04:35.330
- Rez! What's the plan?
- What's up?

01:04:35.361 --> 01:04:37.373
Thanks for doing this, man.
I appreciate it.

01:04:37.405 --> 01:04:40.366
This is pop music, kids.
We have a battle to do, OK?

01:04:40.397 --> 01:04:42.420
You are the troops,
so if I call you "troops",

01:04:42.451 --> 01:04:44.443
just know that we're going into battle.

01:04:44.474 --> 01:04:46.267
What is my lyrics, Ally?

01:04:55.495 --> 01:04:59.290
This is just fine-tuning
and creating an image.

01:04:59.321 --> 01:05:03.430
I know. I just don't wanna lose
the part of me that's...talented.

01:05:03.461 --> 01:05:07.287
I'm not gonna let you lose that piece.
I'm not gonna let you lose that piece.

01:05:07.318 --> 01:05:08.361
OK.

01:05:12.406 --> 01:05:15.357
What are we gonna do with you?

01:05:15.389 --> 01:05:17.432
What are we gonna do with...
Oh, he's beautiful!

01:05:17.463 --> 01:05:21.332
- "You can't send me back. I'm too cute."
- Hey, he's got your eyelashes.

01:05:21.363 --> 01:05:24.282
He does. He's got your eyelashes.
Hey, bud!

01:05:25.408 --> 01:05:28.328
This has never been done before,
just so you know.

01:05:28.359 --> 01:05:30.413
It actually has been done before.

01:05:31.393 --> 01:05:33.385
Would you please...

01:05:33.416 --> 01:05:35.376
Please. Do it for me.

01:05:36.346 --> 01:05:38.431
No, I can't in the water.

01:06:03.340 --> 01:06:05.415
Mm.

01:06:06.531 --> 01:06:08.501
You comin' with me to Memphis?

01:06:11.421 --> 01:06:13.537
- What are you talkin' about?
- I gotta go do this...

01:06:14.517 --> 01:06:17.333
You know, it's one of those paid things.

01:06:18.344 --> 01:06:20.544
Soul-crushing work, really,
but it's kind of never

01:06:20.576 --> 01:06:23.547
what I thought I'd wind up doing, maybe.
I don't know, but...

01:06:25.560 --> 01:06:28.353
I've made peace with it, though.

01:06:28.530 --> 01:06:34.401
Anyway, if you wanna come, I thought...
we could have a laugh, at the very least.

01:06:34.432 --> 01:06:38.415
Rez wants to keep me here because,
you know, they rushed out the single

01:06:38.447 --> 01:06:41.471
and they were so excited
that they want me to finish the album.

01:06:41.502 --> 01:06:44.567
- So I'm working on that.
- Listen to what you're saying.

01:06:44.599 --> 01:06:47.392
Listen to what you just said.

01:06:48.424 --> 01:06:50.593
People wanna hear what you have to say.
That's the stuff.

01:06:51.375 --> 01:06:52.606
- I... I can't...
- Hey, hey.

01:06:53.554 --> 01:06:55.515
Take it in.

01:06:56.443 --> 01:06:58.393
Thank you, by the way.

01:06:58.424 --> 01:07:00.530
- Thank you for what?
- Giving me a home.

01:07:01.448 --> 01:07:03.471
This place never felt like one before.

01:07:40.433 --> 01:07:42.549
Oh, fuck.

01:07:43.467 --> 01:07:45.437
Jack, you OK?

01:07:46.469 --> 01:07:47.585
Jack?

01:08:22.567 --> 01:08:24.610
Is there a reason
why you're not up there?

01:08:53.721 --> 01:08:56.661
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

01:08:57.516 --> 01:08:58.663
Oh, my... Oh, my... Hey!

01:08:58.694 --> 01:09:00.686
- Pretty incredible.
- Did Jack show up?

01:09:00.717 --> 01:09:02.709
- I haven't heard from him.
- What do you mean?

01:09:03.491 --> 01:09:05.523
- I haven't heard from him.
- I can't find him.

01:09:05.555 --> 01:09:06.661
I called him three times.

01:09:06.692 --> 01:09:08.651
What happened
with the dancers there?

01:09:08.682 --> 01:09:12.572
I just thought that I should do it alone
cos it's so overwhelming.

01:09:12.603 --> 01:09:14.532
OK, but you can't go rogue on me.

01:09:14.563 --> 01:09:16.722
You have to understand
that this is what I do

01:09:17.504 --> 01:09:18.651
and you have to trust me, OK?

01:09:18.682 --> 01:09:20.590
So, if I give you a couple of dancers,

01:09:20.622 --> 01:09:24.521
don't not use them
and then miss a couple of steps, OK?

01:09:25.710 --> 01:09:29.525
We also have to change your hair.
We have to change the colour of your hair.

01:09:29.557 --> 01:09:30.662
What's wrong with my hair?

01:09:30.693 --> 01:09:34.520
- I'm thinking platinum, or...
- I don't wanna be fucking blonde.

01:09:34.551 --> 01:09:37.627
I am who I am,
and I'm worried about Jack.

01:09:37.742 --> 01:09:39.723
I will find Jack, OK?

01:09:40.651 --> 01:09:41.725
I will find him.

01:09:47.700 --> 01:09:48.763
Jack.

01:09:50.545 --> 01:09:52.579
I feel like we've done this before.

01:09:54.654 --> 01:09:57.709
Didn't think we'd do it so soon, man.
Come on, bro. Get up.

01:10:00.545 --> 01:10:02.641
All right. There we go.

01:10:04.622 --> 01:10:06.770
In my mind, I made it to the door.

01:10:07.551 --> 01:10:09.720
I almost didn't wake you.
You looked so comfortable.

01:10:11.617 --> 01:10:14.787
- How you doin'?
- I've seen better days, I guess.

01:10:16.664 --> 01:10:18.677
I apologise for...

01:10:18.708 --> 01:10:20.783
- disrespecting your property...
- Not necessary.

01:10:21.565 --> 01:10:24.630
- ..or whatever I did.
- You want some coffee?

01:10:24.662 --> 01:10:26.632
Put some on,
and we'll come in in a minute.

01:10:26.664 --> 01:10:27.769
OK.

01:10:29.697 --> 01:10:31.761
That's him, right? That's your boy.

01:10:31.793 --> 01:10:34.764
Jack, he's as old now...

01:10:35.745 --> 01:10:38.591
..as you were when I met you.

01:10:39.707 --> 01:10:41.605
Saw you on YouTube.

01:10:41.636 --> 01:10:44.639
- That video with the girl.
- Yeah.

01:10:45.807 --> 01:10:48.820
It made me happy, man.
You looked like you.

01:10:49.601 --> 01:10:51.666
You were just...

01:10:51.697 --> 01:10:53.668
just doing it, bro.

01:10:54.690 --> 01:10:56.598
She writes too.

01:10:57.599 --> 01:10:59.622
- She wrote that tune?
- Yeah.

01:10:59.653 --> 01:11:01.613
Bunch of others too.

01:11:02.771 --> 01:11:06.712
Got hooked up with some manager guy,
wants to...

01:11:11.633 --> 01:11:12.842
You know.

01:11:13.624 --> 01:11:15.772
- She's good, bro.
- I know.

01:11:17.670 --> 01:11:19.693
Maybe she's a way out.

01:11:22.831 --> 01:11:25.657
Ain't nothing to be afraid of, bro.

01:11:26.731 --> 01:11:28.628
You know, it's like...

01:11:32.757 --> 01:11:36.646
I don't know... You... You float out...

01:11:37.824 --> 01:11:41.776
..float out at sea,
and then...one day, you find a port,

01:11:42.694 --> 01:11:44.811
say, "I'm gonna stay here
for a few days."

01:11:44.842 --> 01:11:47.646
A few days becomes a few years.

01:11:47.845 --> 01:11:51.650
And then you forgot where you were goin'
in the first place.

01:11:52.776 --> 01:11:56.655
And then you realise you don't really
give a shit about where you was going,

01:11:56.686 --> 01:11:57.875
cos you like where you're at.

01:11:59.752 --> 01:12:00.878
That's how it is for me.

01:12:01.837 --> 01:12:03.714
I like where I'm at.

01:12:04.850 --> 01:12:07.665
I didn't even realise
I liked it so much...

01:12:07.833 --> 01:12:10.803
..till I saw your ass
sleeping in the grass this morning.

01:12:14.859 --> 01:12:18.759
Yeah, come on, man.
You can rest in my daughter's room, bro.

01:12:23.858 --> 01:12:27.841
I thought of, like, a million things
to say to you on the plane...

01:12:27.872 --> 01:12:29.864
and I can't remember.

01:12:31.782 --> 01:12:32.887
Jack...

01:12:33.794 --> 01:12:35.702
Glad you're here.

01:12:36.839 --> 01:12:39.821
You make it to Memphis after all.<i>did </i>

01:12:43.783 --> 01:12:45.712
Fuck.

01:12:46.765 --> 01:12:48.704
I won't do this again.

01:12:49.821 --> 01:12:51.811
I won't come and find you.

01:12:53.907 --> 01:12:56.722
Next time, you can clean up
your own mess.

01:12:57.807 --> 01:12:59.746
You understand me?

01:13:01.779 --> 01:13:02.926
How was the show?

01:13:05.731 --> 01:13:07.785
It was fucking awesome.

01:13:08.828 --> 01:13:10.746
I cut the dancers.

01:13:10.872 --> 01:13:12.842
- Dancers?
- Yeah.

01:13:12.873 --> 01:13:13.915
Ah.

01:13:14.896 --> 01:13:16.825
Good.

01:13:18.837 --> 01:13:20.756
Fucking dancers.

01:13:20.922 --> 01:13:22.810
All you do is need to sing.

01:13:22.841 --> 01:13:24.906
- You made me so upset.
- I'm sorry.

01:13:26.468 --> 01:13:28.460
I saw that video on YouTube.

01:13:28.491 --> 01:13:30.368
- Oh.
- It was great.

01:13:30.400 --> 01:13:32.422
Thank you so much.

01:13:36.499 --> 01:13:39.429
Excuse me one second.

01:13:40.368 --> 01:13:42.442
- What's going on?
- Do you have, like, a plier?

01:13:42.474 --> 01:13:43.505
Jack's OK?

01:13:43.538 --> 01:13:46.498
I wanna cut the guitar strings,
not too crazy.

01:13:46.529 --> 01:13:49.449
There used to be pliers
or something like that.

01:13:49.480 --> 01:13:51.524
Ah... Yeah, yeah.

01:13:52.306 --> 01:13:53.463
I don't know where my mom is.

01:13:53.494 --> 01:13:56.435
- Yeah. I understand that.
- I think you're pretty.

01:13:56.466 --> 01:13:57.509
Me?

01:13:58.479 --> 01:14:02.514
You think I'm pretty?
Thank you. I think you're pretty.

01:14:03.389 --> 01:14:06.527
It was real great,
and then Jack tells me you wrote the song.

01:14:06.559 --> 01:14:09.520
Yeah, he got me to start singing
my own songs again.

01:14:10.417 --> 01:14:13.503
- He has a way of doing that.
- Yeah, he does.

01:14:13.534 --> 01:14:16.412
Does anyone want some
more mac and cheese?

01:14:16.444 --> 01:14:19.332
Yeah? Here, sweetheart,
you want some?

01:14:20.489 --> 01:14:23.470
Ah. There he goes.
What's up, man?

01:14:23.502 --> 01:14:25.524
I understand what you said.

01:14:25.556 --> 01:14:28.486
What the hell are you...

01:14:42.395 --> 01:14:44.511
Are you kidding?

01:14:44.542 --> 01:14:46.419
- That stupid?
- No.

01:14:46.451 --> 01:14:49.391
- It's not stupid.
- It wasn't a stupid thing I just did?

01:14:49.422 --> 01:14:51.518
Is that what you were doing
when you left the table?

01:14:51.549 --> 01:14:53.572
He told me
he was looking for some pliers.

01:14:53.604 --> 01:14:57.576
I didn't know what he was gonna do.
I didn't think he was gonna "do it" do it.

01:14:57.608 --> 01:15:00.402
Oh, she has another ring!

01:15:00.433 --> 01:15:01.559
Well, that's just temporary.

01:15:01.591 --> 01:15:04.582
No, no, no, no, no.
Jack, wait a minute.

01:15:04.615 --> 01:15:07.606
Let's anoint this.
Let's do it today.

01:15:09.556 --> 01:15:11.443
- Yo, for real.
- It's a good idea!

01:15:11.475 --> 01:15:14.457
No, you get the dress.
I'll call my cousin right now.

01:15:14.488 --> 01:15:16.490
It's Saturday.
Nobody's gonna be in there.

01:15:16.521 --> 01:15:18.523
- Let's go.
- You really wanna do that?

01:15:18.555 --> 01:15:21.411
That place has a magical quality to it.

01:15:21.443 --> 01:15:23.496
It what? It has a magical quality?

01:15:23.527 --> 01:15:25.436
- It does.
- What do you mean?

01:15:25.467 --> 01:15:26.624
- That church is special.
- We can go.

01:15:27.406 --> 01:15:29.533
- I'll take you to get a dress.
- There you go, right there.

01:15:29.565 --> 01:15:33.610
It'd be great! OK, you're coming with us
for sure because you're...

01:15:33.642 --> 01:15:38.428
I can't believe this.
What am I doing? OK, sure.

01:15:49.417 --> 01:15:51.523
- My brother. Good to see you.
- Hey, hey!

01:15:51.554 --> 01:15:53.504
- Jack!
- Good to see you, my man.

01:15:55.444 --> 01:15:57.540
- Thank you so much.
- Welcome to the Lord's house.

01:15:57.571 --> 01:16:00.428
<i>With the power...</i>
<i>I think that's how it goes.</i>

01:16:00.459 --> 01:16:02.555
Do you take him...
Do you take him?

01:16:03.503 --> 01:16:04.598
I do.

01:16:05.599 --> 01:16:07.569
I do.

01:16:13.627 --> 01:16:15.588
Congrats, man.

01:16:16.537 --> 01:16:18.560
- I listened to what you said.
- I'm glad you did.

01:16:18.591 --> 01:16:20.572
I can't believe he did it.

01:16:22.605 --> 01:16:25.493
- One thing at a time, OK?
- What?

01:16:27.453 --> 01:16:29.601
Oh! I didn't understand.

01:17:07.501 --> 01:17:08.638
- Lot of people downstairs?
- Yeah.

01:17:08.669 --> 01:17:11.589
- She better come out before they leave.
- Want me to check on her?

01:17:11.620 --> 01:17:14.581
Well, I think we're gonna
have to go pretty soon, so...

01:17:14.613 --> 01:17:16.542
All right.

01:17:17.626 --> 01:17:18.700
Ally.

01:17:20.681 --> 01:17:22.558
I'm coming in.

01:17:26.634 --> 01:17:28.646
What are you doin' in the tub?

01:17:31.608 --> 01:17:33.568
This is so weird.

01:17:33.599 --> 01:17:36.623
I don't know who the hell
I think I am. I...

01:17:36.654 --> 01:17:38.636
One song is fine, but...

01:17:39.564 --> 01:17:42.660
..to put out a whole record,
I don't know what the fuck I was thinking.

01:17:43.588 --> 01:17:46.674
I don't know about all of that,
but you definitely look like a star.

01:17:47.644 --> 01:17:49.604
- Really?
- Yeah.

01:17:50.730 --> 01:17:53.577
What do you think of her hair
and the look and the...?

01:17:53.608 --> 01:17:54.765
- I discussed it with her.
- Yeah.

01:17:55.547 --> 01:17:56.746
- It looks great.
- Was that your choice?

01:17:56.778 --> 01:17:58.696
No, it was actually hers.

01:18:01.564 --> 01:18:02.731
- No drink?
- What's that?

01:18:02.763 --> 01:18:04.692
No drink?

01:18:07.631 --> 01:18:09.696
No socks?

01:18:10.697 --> 01:18:12.626
Touché. Touché, mate.

01:18:12.657 --> 01:18:15.764
Yeah, I could never get used to that,
the idea of not wearing socks.

01:18:15.796 --> 01:18:18.694
- Your feet get all...
- No, actually I am wearing socks.

01:18:18.726 --> 01:18:21.656
They're these kind of
little female insert socks

01:18:21.687 --> 01:18:24.626
- that work with these shoes.
- Oh, you are. You're hiding them.

01:18:24.659 --> 01:18:26.722
Yeah, I'm just hiding them.
That's right.

01:18:26.754 --> 01:18:28.735
OK, now is this thing...
Yeah, there it is.

01:18:28.766 --> 01:18:31.613
Oh, that's a good light.
Here, hold this for me, baby.

01:18:31.644 --> 01:18:33.594
Hey, Ally, girl!

01:18:33.625 --> 01:18:35.731
<i>Wait, hold on. Come on.</i>
<i>Sookie, Donte. Come here.</i>

01:18:35.762 --> 01:18:37.660

- The queen is here!

01:18:52.685 --> 01:18:53.821
- Wow!

01:18:54.603 --> 01:18:55.698
Well, it's beautiful.

01:18:55.729 --> 01:18:59.660
You. SNL. Alec Baldwin hosting.

01:18:59.692 --> 01:19:00.839

01:19:01.621 --> 01:19:02.747

01:19:04.707 --> 01:19:06.666
Oh, gosh!

01:19:06.834 --> 01:19:09.722
- That's incredible! Thank you.
- Congratulations.

01:19:09.753 --> 01:19:11.661
- Congratulations.
- Bitch!

01:19:12.662 --> 01:19:13.778
- Oh, my gosh!
- Get downstairs.

01:19:13.809 --> 01:19:15.644
- Everyone's waiting.
- OK.

01:19:15.675 --> 01:19:17.677
Can I just talk to her
for one second outside?

01:19:17.709 --> 01:19:19.721
Just one sec, sorry.
Just be a second, yeah.

01:19:28.667 --> 01:19:30.752
It doesn't do you any justice,
I'll tell you that.

01:19:31.690 --> 01:19:33.713
You always said you liked my nose.

01:19:33.745 --> 01:19:35.819
- I love your nose.
- It's real big up there.

01:19:35.851 --> 01:19:37.821
I wish it was bigger up there.

01:19:37.853 --> 01:19:40.658
The whole thing should just be
your fucking nose.

01:19:41.794 --> 01:19:44.650
Fuck all those people
who ever said anything.

01:19:44.683 --> 01:19:46.767
Just put a billboard
of your fucking nose up there.

01:19:46.799 --> 01:19:49.645
Just the nose?
That's so ridiculous.

01:19:49.832 --> 01:19:53.691
Listen, if I just don't say this,
I'll never forgive myself.

01:19:55.713 --> 01:19:56.756
What?

01:19:59.874 --> 01:20:02.804
If you don't dig deep
in your fucking soul...

01:20:03.794 --> 01:20:05.776
..you won't have legs.

01:20:06.891 --> 01:20:09.695
I'm just telling you that.

01:20:11.708 --> 01:20:14.679
You don't tell the truth out there,
you're fucked.

01:20:15.857 --> 01:20:18.725
All you got is you,
and what you wanna say to people.

01:20:18.756 --> 01:20:22.802
They are listening now. They're not
gonna be listening forever. Trust me.

01:20:24.741 --> 01:20:26.680
So you gotta grab it.

01:20:26.711 --> 01:20:29.808
And you don't apologise, you don't worry
about why they're listening

01:20:29.839 --> 01:20:33.739
or how long they're gonna be listening,
you just tell 'em what you wanna say.

01:20:44.896 --> 01:20:47.815
Cos how you say it
is the stuff of angels.

01:20:49.723 --> 01:20:52.715
Pop! Six to the right, and hah!

01:20:52.747 --> 01:20:53.800
Ball, change. Down.

01:20:53.831 --> 01:20:55.895
Hah! Ball, change.

01:20:57.793 --> 01:20:59.743
- Attitude.
- Whoo!

01:20:59.774 --> 01:21:00.911
- The last part.
- I know.

01:21:00.942 --> 01:21:02.882
All right!

01:21:03.945 --> 01:21:06.896
30 seconds.

01:21:09.783 --> 01:21:11.744
Red mark.

01:21:12.870 --> 01:21:15.810
Alec in 20.

01:21:15.894 --> 01:21:17.739
15.

01:21:17.771 --> 01:21:19.814
Stand by, guys.
Here we go. Ready? Song one.

01:21:19.846 --> 01:21:20.867
Stand by, Alec.

01:21:20.899 --> 01:21:22.963
- In ten, nine...
- Alec in ten.

01:21:23.745 --> 01:21:25.768
- eight, seven, six...
- Ready 4. Dissolve 4.

01:21:25.799 --> 01:21:26.967
Alec in five seconds.

01:21:27.748 --> 01:21:30.960
- Four, three, two, one...
- And go 4. Dissolve 4.

01:21:31.742 --> 01:21:33.859
- And cue Alec!
- Ladies and gentlemen, Ally.

01:21:33.890 --> 01:21:35.944
Dissolve 1.

01:22:51.953 --> 01:22:54.873
The caterpillar becomes the butterfly.

01:22:56.896 --> 01:22:58.867
What the hell are you doing here?

01:22:58.898 --> 01:23:00.931
I'm in town for a gig.

01:23:00.962 --> 01:23:02.881
Been working for Willie.

01:23:03.058 --> 01:23:05.894
- I've been working for Willie.
- No shit.

01:23:05.926 --> 01:23:08.042
Yeah. Thought I'd stop by
and check her out.

01:23:14.902 --> 01:23:16.842
Is it gettin' worse?

01:23:17.947 --> 01:23:21.044
Nah, I've just been with my wife,
and it's goin' real good.

01:23:25.997 --> 01:23:28.030
Funny to run into you, cos...

01:23:31.929 --> 01:23:34.994
..I was thinking about asking you
to come back out with us.

01:23:38.081 --> 01:23:40.917
I gotta say, it's easier without you.

01:23:48.914 --> 01:23:49.967
Listen.

01:23:51.041 --> 01:23:52.970
You run into any trouble...

01:23:53.898 --> 01:23:55.910
..call me.

01:24:13.896 --> 01:24:15.105
Thank you!

01:24:51.056 --> 01:24:53.162
That light's beautiful.

01:24:54.945 --> 01:24:56.176
Oh, God, here we...

01:24:56.958 --> 01:24:59.106
Yeah, that's it, Ally.
Yeah, that's it.

01:25:00.127 --> 01:25:03.162
That's it, Ally. That's it, I love that.

01:25:04.966 --> 01:25:07.062
Oh, my gosh. It's so early.
I've been here all night.

01:25:07.093 --> 01:25:09.178
- Early for me, late for you.
- Hi, it's nice to see you.

01:25:09.959 --> 01:25:11.065
- How you doin'?
- I'm kind of...

01:25:11.097 --> 01:25:12.983
- He's amazing.
- What do you think?

01:25:13.014 --> 01:25:14.975
These fucking photos.

01:25:15.006 --> 01:25:17.133
- They're so beautiful.
- Look at that! Look at that!

01:25:17.164 --> 01:25:20.094
- That's incredible.
- It doesn't even look like me.

01:25:23.202 --> 01:25:26.142
You've just been nominated
for three Grammys.

01:25:27.060 --> 01:25:29.166
Including Best New Artist.

01:25:30.209 --> 01:25:32.158
They just announced it now.

01:25:40.103 --> 01:25:43.085
Everybody!
Grammy-nominated artist.

01:26:17.180 --> 01:26:20.203
Have you been drinking?
Are you fucked up right now?

01:26:20.235 --> 01:26:22.112
I'm out a couple.

01:26:22.143 --> 01:26:24.051
It's the morning.

01:26:26.262 --> 01:26:28.191
Yup.

01:26:34.185 --> 01:26:36.093
Hey, buddy.

01:27:03.172 --> 01:27:07.092
You're nominated for three Grammys,
and it's fucking great.

01:27:07.123 --> 01:27:09.271
Thank you.
How did you find that out?

01:27:10.283 --> 01:27:12.159
Bobby told me.

01:27:13.307 --> 01:27:15.266
He called. He said that...

01:27:16.204 --> 01:27:20.188
..they wanna do some Roy Orbison tribute.
They want me to sing and shit.

01:27:20.219 --> 01:27:22.190
- Great.
- Some, like, supergroup thing.

01:27:22.221 --> 01:27:25.099
But the point is, you got nominated,
and it's great.

01:27:26.100 --> 01:27:28.216
I'm just trying to figure it out,
that's all.

01:27:31.167 --> 01:27:34.306
"Why do you come around me
with an ass like that?"

01:27:37.141 --> 01:27:39.112
- My lyrics?
- "Why do you walk around in jeans?"

01:27:39.143 --> 01:27:41.093
"Why do you come around
with an ass like that?"

01:27:41.124 --> 01:27:43.168
Yeah, that's my song.
What about my song?

01:27:43.199 --> 01:27:46.202
I fucking listened to it
over and over in the fucking...

01:27:47.328 --> 01:27:49.216
You're not making any sense.

01:27:51.280 --> 01:27:53.251
Yeah, just keep drinking.

01:27:53.282 --> 01:27:56.201
- That'll give you the answer.
- Maybe I fucking failed you.

01:27:56.232 --> 01:27:59.162
- That kills me. I'm sorry.
- You what? You failed me?

01:27:59.193 --> 01:28:01.216
Yeah, you're embarrassing,
and it's just...

01:28:01.247 --> 01:28:03.270
- I'm embarrassing?
- I feel bad for you.

01:28:03.301 --> 01:28:05.168
- Yeah...
- I'm not embarrassing!

01:28:05.199 --> 01:28:07.295
- I have to tell you.
- You're embarrassing!

01:28:07.326 --> 01:28:11.237
You're so embarrassed of your fucking
self that you gotta put me down.

01:28:11.268 --> 01:28:13.291
You're worried that you're ugly,
and you're not.

01:28:13.322 --> 01:28:15.344
So you need to get approval
by all these people.

01:28:16.126 --> 01:28:18.253
- Why can't I just be enough for you?
- I don't need approval.

01:28:18.284 --> 01:28:21.277
I'd like for my boyfriend to love me.
For my to love me.<i>husband </i>

01:28:21.308 --> 01:28:24.144
Who's your fucking boyfriend?
You have a boyfriend?

01:28:24.176 --> 01:28:26.178
- Yeah, I've got a boyfriend.
- That hurts.

01:28:26.209 --> 01:28:28.325
- I have a boyfriend.
- Call me your fucking boyfriend.

01:28:28.357 --> 01:28:32.236
You're my boyfriend. You're my boyfriend
if you don't treat me like your wife.

01:28:32.267 --> 01:28:34.299
I don't even know
what that fucking means.

01:28:34.331 --> 01:28:37.375
It means clean your shit up.
You're fucking messy.

01:28:38.157 --> 01:28:40.295
- That's what it means.
- Well, that's not true.

01:28:40.326 --> 01:28:42.151
- Oh, it isn't?
- Uh-uh.

01:28:42.182 --> 01:28:45.216
Let's go. You wanna be my drinking buddy?
Wanna practise?

01:28:45.248 --> 01:28:48.240
- I don't think you could handle it.
- You don't? Let me see.

01:28:49.252 --> 01:28:53.171
Know why? Cos you're too worried about
what everybody else is thinking.

01:28:53.203 --> 01:28:55.298
Here we go, Jack.
You want me to be your dad?

01:28:55.330 --> 01:28:57.207
- Be your drinking buddy?
- Yeah.

01:28:57.238 --> 01:28:59.313
Yeah, you couldn't be my dad
if you fucking tried.

01:28:59.344 --> 01:29:02.389
He had more talent in his finger
than you have in your whole body.

01:29:03.171 --> 01:29:05.371
So don't even fucking go there
about that, all right?

01:29:05.402 --> 01:29:09.208
- That's over the fucking line.
- Why don't you have another drink

01:29:09.239 --> 01:29:12.378
and we can just get fucking drunk
until we fucking disappear, OK?

01:29:12.409 --> 01:29:16.204
- Do you got those pills?
- You're just fucking ugly, that's all.

01:29:16.235 --> 01:29:18.310
- I'm what?
- You're just fucking ugly.

01:29:18.341 --> 01:29:20.333
Get the fuck out!

01:29:20.364 --> 01:29:22.220
Get out!

01:29:23.221 --> 01:29:25.202
I said, get out!

01:29:25.234 --> 01:29:26.412
Fine.

01:29:47.255 --> 01:29:48.297
Good evening.

01:30:00.225 --> 01:30:01.361
Seven and eight and huh.

01:30:01.393 --> 01:30:04.427
Two, three, four, five, six, seven, up!

01:30:04.458 --> 01:30:06.366
Pull it!

01:30:07.472 --> 01:30:10.329
Six. Come on, feel it. Ooh-huh.

01:30:13.268 --> 01:30:15.354
Down, up! Hah! Swing it!

01:30:26.292 --> 01:30:28.398
- That was great.
- What are you doin' here?

01:30:28.429 --> 01:30:32.433
Something fell through, so I was able
to come back a few days early.

01:30:36.280 --> 01:30:38.376
I think I might have said some things...

01:30:43.287 --> 01:30:46.269
Just...how I acted.

01:30:48.271 --> 01:30:49.397
You hurt me.

01:30:51.326 --> 01:30:53.285
You really hurt me.

01:30:53.318 --> 01:30:54.496
Sorry.

01:31:11.512 --> 01:31:13.472
You haven't been drinking.

01:31:14.421 --> 01:31:15.453
What'd you say?

01:31:15.484 --> 01:31:18.414
I said you haven't been drinking.
I can tell.

01:31:18.445 --> 01:31:20.343
No, I haven't. No.

01:31:21.406 --> 01:31:25.306
- I have to get back to rehearsal...
- Oh, yeah. Can I watch?

01:31:26.380 --> 01:31:28.319
Yeah, OK.

01:31:28.351 --> 01:31:30.311
Meet me at home.

01:31:30.342 --> 01:31:32.344
Or I can wait and drive you home.

01:31:33.512 --> 01:31:35.420
- Just meet me at home.
- OK.

01:31:36.494 --> 01:31:38.505
What do you mean,
they don't want me to sing?

01:31:38.537 --> 01:31:41.331
They hired this fucking kid
at the last minute.

01:31:41.363 --> 01:31:43.427
They didn't tell me a fucking thing.

01:31:48.390 --> 01:31:50.497
Look, we've been
on that other side before.

01:31:51.456 --> 01:31:53.375
More than once.

01:31:53.406 --> 01:31:54.449
Yeah.

01:31:55.450 --> 01:31:57.388
Truth is, I didn't deliver.

01:31:58.337 --> 01:32:00.401
Well, it's a good thing I know the...

01:32:01.465 --> 01:32:04.447
..how to play the guitar.
It's fine, I'll do it.

01:32:05.531 --> 01:32:07.533
- You're gonna do it?
- Sure.

01:32:15.395 --> 01:32:17.596
Hey, where's the wedges?
Can't fucking hear with the...

01:32:49.511 --> 01:32:52.472
But, yeah, like I said,
it's a real, real honour.

01:32:52.504 --> 01:32:54.516
Yeah. Oh, honour's mine.

01:32:54.547 --> 01:32:56.444
Yeah, you're great. It'll be fun.

01:32:56.475 --> 01:32:58.394
- Yeah, hope so.
- Yeah.

01:33:06.121 --> 01:33:09.082
Who coulda been a crooner?

01:33:09.113 --> 01:33:12.106
Right? You remember what Paul said.

01:33:12.137 --> 01:33:16.172
Paul Anka
told me I had more natural talent...

01:33:16.203 --> 01:33:18.080
- ..than Sinatra.
- ..than Frank.

01:33:18.112 --> 01:33:20.020
- That's it! Do not...
- Direct quote!

01:33:20.051 --> 01:33:21.240
Know what Paul Anka actually said?

01:33:22.022 --> 01:33:24.034
- No, what did he say?
- He said...

01:33:24.065 --> 01:33:28.027
"Would you please pull the car over
and let me out over here on the kerb?"

01:33:28.058 --> 01:33:31.155
All right, but... Oh, my God!

01:33:32.104 --> 01:33:33.230
Sweetheart.

01:33:34.012 --> 01:33:35.253
This is unreal.

01:33:36.035 --> 01:33:37.192
The Grammys.

01:33:37.223 --> 01:33:40.185
- Hey, look at everybody. How are you?
- Hey, there he is!

01:33:40.216 --> 01:33:42.197
- Oh, thanks.
- How are you?

01:33:43.208 --> 01:33:45.075
Are you OK?

01:33:45.106 --> 01:33:47.098
- What's that?
- Are you OK?

01:33:47.233 --> 01:33:49.057
- Are you OK?
- Oh.

01:33:49.088 --> 01:33:50.142
- I'm great.
- Are you sure?

01:33:50.173 --> 01:33:52.029
Yeah, I'm great.

01:33:52.060 --> 01:33:55.042
They have me going in early,
so I gotta go now and then...

01:33:55.074 --> 01:33:58.170
But I made sure that they tell me where
you're sitting so I can go right after.

01:33:58.202 --> 01:34:00.131
- OK.
- I don't wanna miss the award.

01:34:00.162 --> 01:34:01.246
- OK.
- It's right before it.

01:34:01.278 --> 01:34:03.207
You just got that look on your face.

01:34:03.238 --> 01:34:05.282
I do? Watch. It's gone.

01:34:06.064 --> 01:34:08.097
Amazing. Gonna get to see
you perform tonight,

01:34:08.128 --> 01:34:09.233
get to see you sing.

01:34:09.265 --> 01:34:14.290
Hey, Jack, that's an incredible...
collection of vinyl you have in there.

01:34:15.072 --> 01:34:17.074
Take whatever you want.
It's yours.

01:34:17.230 --> 01:34:20.243
- Take whatever I want?
- He just said, "Take whatever you want."

01:34:20.275 --> 01:34:23.163
He's talking to the wrong guys.

01:35:04.098 --> 01:35:05.307
I thought he was supposed to be singing.

01:36:14.393 --> 01:36:17.188
Oh, it's over? It's over?

01:36:18.345 --> 01:36:20.285
- You good?
- I'm fine.

01:36:27.292 --> 01:36:29.273
And the nominees are...

01:36:29.304 --> 01:36:31.253
- Right here?
<i>- Roxy Carlile.</i>

01:36:31.284 --> 01:36:32.337
Hi. Are you OK?

01:36:32.369 --> 01:36:35.288
Come on, baby.
Sit down, sit down, sit down.

01:36:35.319 --> 01:36:38.343
- Hi. You OK?
- I was trying to go to the men's room

01:36:38.374 --> 01:36:41.263
- and they rushed me over here.
- OK, put your legs inside.

01:36:41.294 --> 01:36:43.421
- I had to go to the bathroom.
- Put your legs inside.

01:36:44.203 --> 01:36:46.414
They're announcing your fucking category.
Keep quiet.

01:36:47.196 --> 01:36:49.396
- And the winner is...
- Yeah... Oh...

01:36:49.427 --> 01:36:51.377
This is exciting.

01:36:51.408 --> 01:36:53.201
How great.

01:36:53.232 --> 01:36:54.400
Ally!

01:36:58.310 --> 01:37:01.251
Oh, my God!

01:37:01.417 --> 01:37:03.388
Oh, my God!

01:37:05.421 --> 01:37:08.258
- What happened?
- We won!

01:37:08.289 --> 01:37:11.249
- Is that why everybody's...
- Yep, that's right!

01:37:13.345 --> 01:37:15.243
Where are we going?

01:37:15.274 --> 01:37:17.234
Just stay right here.
Go sit back there.

01:37:17.266 --> 01:37:18.402
Go sit back there.

01:37:20.414 --> 01:37:22.448
I'll stay here.

01:37:28.235 --> 01:37:31.457
Oh, my gosh, thank you!
You look beautiful. Thank you!

01:37:32.406 --> 01:37:34.365
Oh, wow!

01:37:34.396 --> 01:37:36.367
Oh, my gosh!

01:37:36.398 --> 01:37:39.328
I can't believe I'm holding one of these.

01:37:39.453 --> 01:37:42.415
Thank you to Rez Gavron, my manager.

01:37:42.446 --> 01:37:45.407
- Thank you for believing in me...
- Wait, did you win?

01:37:45.438 --> 01:37:48.483
..and telling me to get back from
behind the piano and onto the stage.

01:37:49.265 --> 01:37:51.497
Did you just win?

01:37:53.436 --> 01:37:57.314
Thank you to my...my...
to Jack Maine, my husband.

01:37:57.345 --> 01:37:59.410
- Should I come up there?
- I love you so much.

01:37:59.441 --> 01:38:02.507
I always wanted to be a singer
on a big stage

01:38:03.289 --> 01:38:05.364
and because of him, I am.

01:38:08.492 --> 01:38:11.422
- We're having a lot of fun tonight.
- Yeah.

01:38:12.464 --> 01:38:14.288
- I...
- Shit.

01:38:15.310 --> 01:38:16.363
Look.

01:38:22.484 --> 01:38:25.518
- If I haven't thanked you yet, just...
- Did you see you're up there?

01:38:26.300 --> 01:38:27.406
Yeah, I do.

01:38:29.314 --> 01:38:32.347
I started out singing
with this beautiful man

01:38:32.378 --> 01:38:34.432
and I'll sing with him for life.

01:38:34.464 --> 01:38:36.466
- Right, baby?
- Yeah.

01:38:39.417 --> 01:38:41.544
I'm so blessed to be in the company

01:38:42.326 --> 01:38:44.505
of such wonderful musicians.

01:38:44.536 --> 01:38:47.310
This is a dream come true,
and all I can say is...

01:38:47.341 --> 01:38:49.489
..believe in yourself and don't give up

01:38:49.520 --> 01:38:51.522
because there is a spot
on that stage for you.

01:38:51.554 --> 01:38:54.347
- Oh, shit. Oh, fuck.
- Good night.

01:38:54.557 --> 01:38:56.558
Oh, I think I peed...

01:38:58.341 --> 01:38:59.508
- I think I peed myself.
- Turn around.

01:38:59.540 --> 01:39:01.427
Oh!

01:39:03.398 --> 01:39:05.369
- I think I...
- Baby, baby, can you...

01:39:05.400 --> 01:39:06.568
- That's a bad come down.
- Holy shit!

01:39:07.350 --> 01:39:10.426
- Take him to the shower.
- Follow me, Wolf. Ally, go inside, OK?

01:39:10.457 --> 01:39:12.354
- It's on the left, Dad.
- I got it.

01:39:12.385 --> 01:39:13.522
- Go inside!
- They got him.

01:39:13.554 --> 01:39:15.409
- They got him!
- It's my job!

01:39:15.440 --> 01:39:17.400
- Don't do this to my daughter!
- Hey, hey!

01:39:17.432 --> 01:39:19.340
What the fuck is wrong with you?

01:39:19.371 --> 01:39:20.508
Get off!

01:39:21.550 --> 01:39:23.427
Damn it!

01:39:23.459 --> 01:39:25.440
Watch his fucking head.

01:39:26.430 --> 01:39:27.463
Watch! Watch!

01:39:28.578 --> 01:39:30.507
Bobby'll take you there.

01:39:32.405 --> 01:39:34.437
You have Bobby's number?

01:39:36.408 --> 01:39:38.504
No, Jack, you gotta sit up.

01:39:40.370 --> 01:39:42.581
I don't want you to choke, baby. Sit up!

01:39:43.363 --> 01:39:45.500
Sorry, I...I might've taken too much.

01:39:45.532 --> 01:39:48.389
- You all right in there?
- I'm fine.

01:39:49.515 --> 01:39:51.506
He's fine.

01:39:54.520 --> 01:39:57.397
So, everybody has their journal...

01:39:57.428 --> 01:39:59.524
and we remember
the homework assignment -

01:39:59.555 --> 01:40:02.496
the three things that I wanted you
to write down.

01:40:03.403 --> 01:40:05.603
- Jack, hey.
- I'm sorry. I'm sorry I'm late.

01:40:06.614 --> 01:40:08.564
You can't be late, Jack.

01:40:09.544 --> 01:40:11.463
Understood. Sorry.

01:40:11.494 --> 01:40:13.548
Good. Where's your journal?

01:40:15.487 --> 01:40:17.635
- It's in my room.
- No, no, no, no. No.

01:40:19.459 --> 01:40:20.638
Sit down.

01:40:21.607 --> 01:40:24.485
So, it's all agreed.
Nobody's ever late here, right?

01:40:24.517 --> 01:40:26.571
OK. Good.

01:40:28.448 --> 01:40:30.460
Anything you wanna tell us?

01:40:30.491 --> 01:40:32.493
Um...

01:40:36.507 --> 01:40:38.415
I'm grateful to...

01:40:40.438 --> 01:40:42.450
..to be here and...

01:40:44.483 --> 01:40:46.496
..trying to hold it together.

01:40:49.520 --> 01:40:51.490
I'm Jack. I'm an alcoholic.

01:40:51.522 --> 01:40:53.471
Jack.

01:40:53.503 --> 01:40:54.629
Drug addict.

01:41:08.569 --> 01:41:10.550
Oh...

01:41:10.581 --> 01:41:13.522
- This is all my fault.
- You don't have that kind of power, Dad.

01:41:13.553 --> 01:41:15.492
Eat your dinner. Eat your food.

01:41:15.523 --> 01:41:17.608
Sorry.
I don't even know what meal it is.

01:41:20.486 --> 01:41:21.612
Go on, have some fruit.

01:41:24.532 --> 01:41:27.587
How many times did you carry
my piano up the stairs?

01:41:29.589 --> 01:41:32.644
How many times did you sit there
while I wrote a song?

01:41:36.491 --> 01:41:38.639
- Always.
- OK, it's OK. It's OK.

01:41:39.546 --> 01:41:41.610
You didn't do anything.
It's not your fault.

01:41:44.551 --> 01:41:46.678
You're just the greatest person
in the world.

01:41:55.540 --> 01:41:57.667
<i>How long have you been here now?</i>

01:41:58.710 --> 01:42:00.608
<i>Two months.</i>

01:42:02.672 --> 01:42:04.497
Can it be fixed?

01:42:04.528 --> 01:42:06.739
Well, you would know that, don't you?
Once it's gone, it's gone.

01:42:07.521 --> 01:42:10.576
- I don't know what you have.
- Oh, the tinnitus, they say, once you...

01:42:10.607 --> 01:42:13.537
- Well, tinnitus can't be fixed.
- Right.

01:42:14.580 --> 01:42:18.572
Well, I just hear that tone, that's all.
The tone, yeah.

01:42:18.604 --> 01:42:20.564
The ringing.

01:42:20.595 --> 01:42:23.577
- I have hearing aids on, as you...
- I know. That's why I asked you.

01:42:23.609 --> 01:42:25.621
You know, I'm convinced that...

01:42:27.550 --> 01:42:29.615
..it happened when I was younger.
I used to...

01:42:29.646 --> 01:42:33.587
My dad had, like, a Victrola,
you know, an old record player.

01:42:33.619 --> 01:42:36.579
My head was just about the size of it
when I was a kid,

01:42:36.610 --> 01:42:39.613
and I used to love to just
put my whole head in there.

01:42:40.541 --> 01:42:43.596
He was big into the blues, so...

01:42:44.722 --> 01:42:47.684
Cos you gotta figure,
it's just me and him all day long.

01:42:47.715 --> 01:42:51.782
My brother's out there
tryin' to make something of himself.

01:42:53.638 --> 01:42:56.766
So I took one of his belts.
I put it around the...

01:42:58.548 --> 01:42:59.747
..ceiling fan and...

01:43:00.790 --> 01:43:02.677
..tried to do the deed.

01:43:04.648 --> 01:43:06.775
The whole fucking fan
came out of the ceiling.

01:43:14.741 --> 01:43:17.670
Had a big cut on my fucking forehead.

01:43:18.598 --> 01:43:21.810
I was more mad about that
than it not working.

01:43:23.780 --> 01:43:25.730
And he didn't even notice.

01:43:27.597 --> 01:43:28.702
He didn't even fucking notice.

01:43:28.733 --> 01:43:30.704
- Cos he was drunk?
- Yeah.

01:43:33.644 --> 01:43:36.793
That fucking fan stayed on the floor
for about half a year.

01:43:39.639 --> 01:43:41.631
How old were you then?

01:43:41.662 --> 01:43:43.664
I was just shy of 13.

01:43:52.715 --> 01:43:54.696
Oh...

01:43:58.782 --> 01:44:00.763
You smell good.

01:44:00.794 --> 01:44:03.797
You smell good,
and you look good too.

01:44:07.781 --> 01:44:09.793
- I've been swimming.
- You've been swimming?

01:44:09.824 --> 01:44:12.754
- Yeah, there's a pool.
- I love that you're swimming.

01:44:12.786 --> 01:44:15.621
- That's a great pool there.
- Yeah.

01:44:15.653 --> 01:44:16.696
How's Charlie?

01:44:16.727 --> 01:44:18.749
Oh, Charlie's sweet.

01:44:18.780 --> 01:44:21.669
He just sort of sits
by the door like this.

01:44:24.703 --> 01:44:25.850
Waiting for Daddy.

01:44:29.875 --> 01:44:31.814
We're both waiting for Daddy.

01:44:34.869 --> 01:44:36.788
What, three weeks?

01:44:37.778 --> 01:44:39.821
You gonna come back, right?<i>are </i>

01:44:40.780 --> 01:44:44.753
- What do you mean?
- You gonna come home when you're done?

01:44:44.784 --> 01:44:46.859
- Do you not want me to?
- No, I want you to.

01:44:46.891 --> 01:44:50.728
- I'm just wondering if... I just...
- Where else would I go?

01:44:50.759 --> 01:44:52.824
- I don't know. I guess I just thought...
- Why...

01:44:52.855 --> 01:44:54.721
- ..there's Jack...
- Wait, wait.

01:44:54.753 --> 01:44:57.703
- Wait. Why would you say that?
- I don't know. I guess...

01:44:57.734 --> 01:45:00.851
I wondered, without the booze,
if you would want to come home.

01:45:00.883 --> 01:45:03.886
Cos when you met me,
you were drinking, and now you're not.

01:45:04.668 --> 01:45:06.701
I wasn't drunk the whole time
we were together.

01:45:06.732 --> 01:45:08.724
I know, but...

01:45:09.850 --> 01:45:12.728
But it got bad when we were together.

01:45:12.759 --> 01:45:14.761
It's OK. I mean, it's fine.

01:45:14.793 --> 01:45:16.867
I just was wondering, that's all,

01:45:16.899 --> 01:45:20.745
and whatever you want is OK.

01:45:20.777 --> 01:45:22.872
Whatever I want?
I wanna be with you.

01:45:22.904 --> 01:45:25.875
- That's why I'm here.
- OK. I know, I know.

01:45:25.907 --> 01:45:28.753
I just want you to be happy.

01:45:29.838 --> 01:45:31.756
I'm working on that.

01:45:35.740 --> 01:45:36.907
I need to stick with you.

01:45:40.869 --> 01:45:42.746
I brought something.

01:45:44.935 --> 01:45:46.937
I wanna know...

01:45:47.855 --> 01:45:49.794
..what this is.

01:45:50.868 --> 01:45:52.849
"My Love."

01:45:53.767 --> 01:45:55.863
You hiding love songs?

01:45:55.894 --> 01:45:57.906
No, I wouldn't...

01:45:57.938 --> 01:46:00.856
I wouldn't say I was hiding it.
I just um...

01:46:03.745 --> 01:46:06.737
I started puttin' it down to paper
when we were at home.

01:46:08.906 --> 01:46:12.785
I don't know, it sort of fell out of me,
I guess, and onto this page.

01:46:16.883 --> 01:46:18.937
And I put it in here, and I thought...

01:46:21.897 --> 01:46:24.963
I thought maybe you'd find it when...

01:46:28.852 --> 01:46:30.854
..when you came back to you, maybe.

01:46:39.967 --> 01:46:41.843
Well, I found it.

01:46:49.893 --> 01:46:51.832
Listen. Um...

01:46:56.858 --> 01:46:57.953
Um...

01:47:12.967 --> 01:47:14.959
I'm sorry.

01:47:21.881 --> 01:47:23.007
It's OK.

01:47:29.837 --> 01:47:31.933
It's OK. It's not your fault.

01:47:31.964 --> 01:47:33.956
I'm sorry I did that.

01:47:35.999 --> 01:47:37.949
It's OK.

01:47:37.981 --> 01:47:40.816
It's not your fault. It's a disease.

01:47:42.880 --> 01:47:44.882
No, but I embarrassed you.

01:47:46.926 --> 01:47:49.940
- I embarrassed you, and I...
- I'm not embarrassed of you.

01:47:50.847 --> 01:47:52.035
It was so wrong.

01:47:53.026 --> 01:47:55.966
And then your...then your dad...

01:47:58.864 --> 01:48:00.835
My father loves you. It's OK.

01:48:03.004 --> 01:48:04.933
I know, but I...

01:48:07.060 --> 01:48:09.875
- It's OK.
- I know, but I...

01:48:10.011 --> 01:48:11.971
It's OK.

01:48:13.024 --> 01:48:14.901
It's OK.

01:48:15.975 --> 01:48:19.853
I have figured out what I think is
the best solution for both of us.

01:48:19.884 --> 01:48:21.928
Jack should come out on tour with me.

01:48:21.959 --> 01:48:24.076
We'll start with our duets.
I know he's gonna be able

01:48:24.858 --> 01:48:27.047
- to play by himself.
- You realise that's not an option.

01:48:27.079 --> 01:48:30.906
He's... He's so inside of his art
in a way he has never been.

01:48:30.937 --> 01:48:33.095
- He can hear himself again.
- Ally, there is no way

01:48:33.877 --> 01:48:36.912
that you can take Jack on tour with you.
There's no way.

01:48:50.038 --> 01:48:51.978
Do you understand what I'm saying?

01:48:52.009 --> 01:48:55.043
If you can't make that happen,
then fucking cancel the tour.

01:48:55.074 --> 01:48:57.076
I don't know what to tell you.

01:49:14.134 --> 01:49:18.003
I think if we had a better band name,
we might've made it.

01:49:20.994 --> 01:49:24.101
Or maybe it was cos we looked like
a father and son duo.

01:49:24.133 --> 01:49:28.074
Not many of those around.

01:49:28.105 --> 01:49:31.932
I was not a good look for you,
that's for sure.

01:49:31.964 --> 01:49:34.164
Not my fault I couldn't find
a better guitar player

01:49:34.946 --> 01:49:37.000
in the whole goddamn state.

01:49:43.036 --> 01:49:44.163
Where in the fuck is it?

01:49:45.153 --> 01:49:47.030
Right here.

01:49:55.027 --> 01:49:56.153
Thanks for the ride.

01:50:00.001 --> 01:50:01.169
Sure thing, Jack.

01:50:03.171 --> 01:50:07.049
Hey, you know...when I...

01:50:15.130 --> 01:50:17.987
..when I said I...
you know, when I...

01:50:25.076 --> 01:50:27.109
..took your voice, you know.

01:50:36.994 --> 01:50:39.028
It was you I idolised. It wasn't Dad.

01:51:27.073 --> 01:51:28.219
Come here.

01:51:30.190 --> 01:51:32.265
What was that, guy?

01:51:42.254 --> 01:51:44.099
Hey.

01:51:44.267 --> 01:51:46.164
Hey.

01:51:48.051 --> 01:51:50.053
I wanna know how you hear this.

01:51:51.137 --> 01:51:53.212
That sounded unbelievable,
what you were playing.

01:51:53.243 --> 01:51:55.214
- Thank you.
- It's nice to hear it.

01:51:55.245 --> 01:51:59.218
Thank you, and I had
the beautiful backdrop of you and Charlie.

01:52:01.189 --> 01:52:03.274
I only heard it in my mind
for so many weeks,

01:52:03.306 --> 01:52:06.266
so it's good to hear it... You know.

01:52:06.297 --> 01:52:10.124
- The words are beautiful.
- ..in the real thing. In the real thing.

01:52:15.233 --> 01:52:17.277
- Well, you want me to do that?
- Mm-hm.

01:52:17.308 --> 01:52:20.217
Oh, God, I don't know.
I knew you were gonna ask me.

01:52:46.158 --> 01:52:48.181
Back from the dead.

01:52:50.162 --> 01:52:52.237
- Hey, sorry. Were you waiting long?
- No, no.

01:52:54.156 --> 01:52:56.168
Uh... Ally's not home.

01:52:56.199 --> 01:52:58.274
No, I told her I'd meet her here,
if that's OK.

01:52:58.305 --> 01:53:00.120
Of course, yeah.

01:53:05.333 --> 01:53:07.147
Here you go.

01:53:07.178 --> 01:53:10.275
Hey, thanks for taking care of my girl
when I was gone.

01:53:10.306 --> 01:53:12.183
Anything for her.

01:53:13.236 --> 01:53:15.374
She told me about that European leg.

01:53:16.302 --> 01:53:19.357
That's a hell of an accomplishment
this soon out of the gate.

01:53:20.139 --> 01:53:25.268
Shit, I remember it was like...ten years
before I even went across the pond.

01:53:25.300 --> 01:53:27.249
It was summer, 2004.

01:53:27.280 --> 01:53:29.262
Shit, was it?

01:53:35.184 --> 01:53:37.165
We're not exactly friends here.

01:53:40.189 --> 01:53:43.203
While you've been away,
we've been back here in serious triage,

01:53:43.234 --> 01:53:45.330
trying to clean up your fucking mess.

01:53:45.361 --> 01:53:47.372
Barely finding our way through it.

01:53:49.353 --> 01:53:53.399
You almost single-handedly derailed
her whole career. You understand that?

01:53:54.181 --> 01:53:56.183
She's never gonna say this to you.

01:53:57.226 --> 01:53:58.394
She loves you too much.

01:54:00.364 --> 01:54:03.232
Just by staying married to you,
she looks like a joke.

01:54:03.263 --> 01:54:04.410
It's embarrassing.

01:54:06.265 --> 01:54:08.403
Let's be honest, we both know
it's only a matter of time

01:54:09.185 --> 01:54:11.374
before that's pushed aside again
for the real thing.

01:54:12.386 --> 01:54:14.325
And when that happens...

01:54:15.410 --> 01:54:18.194
..I don't want her anywhere near you.

01:54:29.505 --> 01:54:30.632
Hey.

01:54:34.531 --> 01:54:35.678
I have some good news.

01:54:36.637 --> 01:54:38.556
- Yeah?
- Mm-hm.

01:54:38.587 --> 01:54:40.558
I'm not gonna go to Europe.

01:54:41.538 --> 01:54:45.626
We're gonna cancel the rest of the tour,
and I'm just gonna be here all summer.

01:54:48.514 --> 01:54:49.671
Isn't that great?

01:54:51.599 --> 01:54:53.726
- What happened?
- Nothing happened.

01:54:54.675 --> 01:54:57.730
The label just loves the record,
and it's doing so well

01:54:57.762 --> 01:55:02.735
and they wanna keep with the momentum
and have me make another one.

01:55:03.768 --> 01:55:07.553
Rez is super psyched, so it'll be great.

01:55:09.721 --> 01:55:11.765
So tonight's gonna be my last show.

01:55:13.683 --> 01:55:16.582
Going out with a bang at the Forum.

01:55:19.595 --> 01:55:20.617
Great.

01:55:20.648 --> 01:55:21.743
Yeah.

01:55:25.705 --> 01:55:27.697
Why don't you come with me?

01:55:29.688 --> 01:55:33.639
We can sing Shallow together.
The fans will go crazy to see you.

01:55:37.560 --> 01:55:38.801
Come on, cowboy.

01:55:43.722 --> 01:55:45.662
Yeah, why not? OK.

01:55:47.601 --> 01:55:48.706
Yeah?

01:55:48.738 --> 01:55:50.594
OK, good.

01:55:50.625 --> 01:55:51.803
I'll have a car come get you.

01:55:52.584 --> 01:55:54.576
When I... Once I get there.

01:55:54.607 --> 01:55:55.744
I'll go meet you there.

01:56:04.805 --> 01:56:06.807
I'll see you soon, OK?

01:56:11.676 --> 01:56:13.594
Hey.

01:56:13.698 --> 01:56:15.679
What?

01:56:17.671 --> 01:56:19.787
I just wanted to take
another look at you.

01:56:23.729 --> 01:56:25.783
Bye, honey.

01:56:26.826 --> 01:56:28.828
Bye.

01:56:59.669 --> 01:57:00.826
Come here, Charlie.

01:57:00.858 --> 01:57:02.745
Come here.

01:57:38.748 --> 01:57:40.864
Thank you so much
for bringing us all here together.

01:57:40.896 --> 01:57:44.743
Please look over
all of the dancers tonight and the band.

01:57:44.775 --> 01:57:45.849
And my husband, Jackson.

01:57:45.880 --> 01:57:48.800
We're so excited for him
to be here with us.

01:57:48.831 --> 01:57:50.718
We got a big night.

01:57:50.749 --> 01:57:51.907
We're at the Forum, LA.
Let's do this.

02:00:00.997 --> 02:00:03.844
- Is he here?
- He's not here.

02:00:03.875 --> 02:00:06.899
- He's not here?
- We have to do Shallow regardless, OK?

02:00:06.931 --> 02:00:09.902
The guitar's up there.
Everything's gonna remain the same.

02:00:09.934 --> 02:00:11.039
- What?
- The guitar's up there.

02:00:11.821 --> 02:00:13.927
Everything's gonna remain the same.
Both verses.

02:00:13.958 --> 02:00:17.045
- I'm sure it was just a bit much for him.
- Please send somebody to the house.

02:00:17.826 --> 02:00:19.995
- I'm doing it right now.
- I have 15 seconds.

02:00:50.044 --> 02:00:52.860
Give it up for my husband, Jackson!

02:01:52.010 --> 02:01:53.980
I can stay, if you want.

02:02:18.044 --> 02:02:19.087
Aargh!

02:02:31.193 --> 02:02:35.967
Some kid started singing one of his songs
in a bar I was in the other night.

02:02:39.054 --> 02:02:41.108
They're playing his songs everywhere.

02:02:45.133 --> 02:02:47.124
At first I got angry.

02:02:49.012 --> 02:02:51.107
I don't know why.

02:02:52.067 --> 02:02:54.027
I guess I felt like...

02:02:55.195 --> 02:02:58.166
.."How can any of these people
feel like they knew him?"

02:02:59.083 --> 02:03:01.033
Who he really was.

02:03:04.140 --> 02:03:06.163
But then something changed.

02:03:08.123 --> 02:03:10.125
And it soothed me.

02:03:13.045 --> 02:03:17.027
That it wasn't...
wasn't all for fucking nothing.

02:03:18.018 --> 02:03:20.208
The last thing I did was lie to him.

02:03:23.023 --> 02:03:24.170
Listen to me.

02:03:26.192 --> 02:03:28.132
It isn't your fault.

02:03:30.051 --> 02:03:31.177
It just isn't.

02:03:33.199 --> 02:03:36.036
You know whose fault it was?

02:03:36.067 --> 02:03:37.110
Jack.

02:03:40.049 --> 02:03:41.154
That's it.

02:03:43.063 --> 02:03:44.230
No-one else.

02:03:44.262 --> 02:03:47.067
Not you, not me.

02:03:47.265 --> 02:03:49.079
No-one but Jack.

02:03:49.110 --> 02:03:51.029
I just keep...

02:03:52.051 --> 02:03:55.148
..going over and over it,
over it in my head.

02:03:59.119 --> 02:04:03.259
Jack talked about how music is
essentially 12 notes between any octave.

02:04:07.169 --> 02:04:09.286
12 notes and the octave repeats.

02:04:13.154 --> 02:04:15.125
It's the same story.

02:04:16.168 --> 02:04:18.295
Told over and over.

02:04:19.233 --> 02:04:21.088
Forever.

02:04:22.277 --> 02:04:25.259
All any artist can offer the world...

02:04:25.290 --> 02:04:28.116
is how they see those 12 notes.

02:04:28.147 --> 02:04:30.108
That's it.

02:04:30.295 --> 02:04:32.255
Hm.

02:04:37.146 --> 02:04:39.157
<i>He loved how you see them.</i>

02:04:41.128 --> 02:04:43.120
<i>He just kept saying...</i>

02:04:43.318 --> 02:04:47.113
<i>.."I love how she sees them, Bobby."</i>

02:04:55.225 --> 02:04:58.092
Hello, I'm Ally Maine.

02:05:00.198 --> 02:05:03.326
Thank you for being here tonight
to honour my husband.

02:05:04.108 --> 02:05:05.255
He wrote a song for me.

02:05:06.162 --> 02:05:08.300
I'd like to sing it for him tonight.

02:05:10.229 --> 02:05:12.304
And, with your help, maybe I can.

02:05:14.150 --> 02:05:16.162
Thank you.

02:05:17.132 --> 02:05:18.185
Really.

02:05:19.196 --> 02:05:21.135
Thank you.

02:11:51.662 --> 02:11:53.664
