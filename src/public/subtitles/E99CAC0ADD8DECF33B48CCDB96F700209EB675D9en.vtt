<i>7:00 a.m. in Philadelphia.</i>

00:01:15.799 --> 00:01:18.901

<i>the Prince
and Princess of Wales.</i>

00:02:27.304 --> 00:02:28.506
David, look at me.

00:04:02.133 --> 00:04:03.901
Oi! You missed one, Pakkie!

00:04:04.634 --> 00:04:05.969
I'm not from Pakistan.

00:04:28.524 --> 00:04:30.224
Dinner is ready.

00:04:30.226 --> 00:04:31.493
I'm not hungry, Mum.

00:04:31.495 --> 00:04:32.930
Hmm, where are you going?

00:04:33.629 --> 00:04:36.632
- Out with friends.
- A girl?

00:04:36.634 --> 00:04:39.334
- Oh, Mum.
- Look at you.

00:04:39.336 --> 00:04:40.805
Give your mother
a kiss.

00:04:44.507 --> 00:04:46.007
I'm going to be late.

00:04:46.009 --> 00:04:47.409
You're always late.

00:04:47.411 --> 00:04:49.814
Hi, Papa.
How was work?

00:04:52.882 --> 00:04:54.281
Out again, Farrokh?

00:04:54.283 --> 00:04:56.050
It's Freddie now, Papa.

00:04:56.052 --> 00:04:57.853
Freddie or Farrokh...

00:04:57.855 --> 00:04:59.921
what difference does it make
when you're out every night...

00:04:59.923 --> 00:05:01.858
no thought of the future
in your head?

00:05:03.360 --> 00:05:05.860
Good thoughts,
good words, good deeds.

00:05:05.862 --> 00:05:07.962
That's what
you should aspire to.

00:05:07.964 --> 00:05:08.897
Yes.

00:05:08.899 --> 00:05:11.168
And how's that
worked out for you?

00:05:35.425 --> 00:05:37.192
Yeah, they're better
than last week.

00:05:37.194 --> 00:05:39.228
- They're a cool band.
- Yeah, not bad.

00:05:39.230 --> 00:05:40.230
Yeah.

00:05:47.904 --> 00:05:49.171
What can I get for you?

00:05:49.173 --> 00:05:50.173
Pint of lager.

00:05:53.377 --> 00:05:54.846
- Thank you.
- Thanks.

00:06:34.350 --> 00:06:35.786
See you, mate.

00:06:36.553 --> 00:06:37.952
Humpy Bong?

00:06:37.954 --> 00:06:39.021
Humpy Bong.

00:06:39.023 --> 00:06:40.889
They're going places.
They're gonna be big.

00:06:40.891 --> 00:06:43.093
Humpy Bong?
Are you joking?

00:06:44.124 --> 00:06:44.259
Don't do it, Tim.

00:06:44.261 --> 00:06:45.394
No, I'm sorry, guys,
but...

00:06:45.396 --> 00:06:47.062
we're not going anywhere
with this.

00:06:47.064 --> 00:06:49.734
What? College gigs, pubs?

00:06:51.701 --> 00:06:52.903
Gotta give it a go.

00:06:56.173 --> 00:06:58.774
So I just said to him,
"No, you can't do that."

00:06:58.776 --> 00:07:00.778
You literally
can't hear anything.

00:07:02.178 --> 00:07:03.978
It's a bit silly.

00:07:03.980 --> 00:07:06.884
But then everyone else was
in, like, long dresses?

00:07:07.418 --> 00:07:08.985
How bizarre.

00:07:13.257 --> 00:07:14.591
You all right?

00:07:16.093 --> 00:07:19.827
Sorry. Oh, I was just
looking for the band.

00:07:19.829 --> 00:07:21.731
They're usually out back.

00:07:29.673 --> 00:07:31.141
I like your coat.

00:07:34.177 --> 00:07:36.213
It's from Biba.

00:07:38.514 --> 00:07:39.916
She works there.

00:07:40.550 --> 00:07:41.752
Thank you.

00:07:46.288 --> 00:07:47.555
I think he's right.

00:07:47.557 --> 00:07:48.824
That show
was a load of bollocks.

00:07:48.826 --> 00:07:51.360
Well, there was room
for improvement, yeah.

00:07:51.362 --> 00:07:54.695
I've got better things to do
with my Saturday nights.

00:07:54.697 --> 00:07:56.166
I could give you
their names.

00:07:59.702 --> 00:08:01.702
I enjoyed the show.

00:08:01.704 --> 00:08:03.240
- Thanks, man.
- Thank you.

00:08:05.608 --> 00:08:07.611
I've been following you
for a while, actually.

00:08:08.177 --> 00:08:09.810
Smile.

00:08:09.812 --> 00:08:12.481
Makes sense
for a dental student.

00:08:12.483 --> 00:08:14.882
And you're astrophysics,
aren't you?

00:08:14.884 --> 00:08:17.851
- Yeah.
- Makes you the clever one.

00:08:17.853 --> 00:08:19.488
Yeah, I suppose
it does, yeah.

00:08:19.490 --> 00:08:20.887
I study design here.

00:08:20.889 --> 00:08:22.289
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah.

00:08:22.291 --> 00:08:25.594
Also, um, I write songs.

00:08:25.596 --> 00:08:28.029
Might be
of interest to you.

00:08:28.031 --> 00:08:30.332
It's just a bit of fun,
really.

00:08:30.334 --> 00:08:32.300
Well, you're
five minutes too late.

00:08:32.302 --> 00:08:34.071
Our lead singer
just quit.

00:08:37.841 --> 00:08:40.074
Well, then you'll need
someone new.

00:08:40.076 --> 00:08:41.111
Any ideas?

00:08:44.414 --> 00:08:45.948
What about me?

00:08:45.950 --> 00:08:48.650
Uh, not with those teeth,
mate.

00:08:58.794 --> 00:09:02.897
<i>♪ I know what I'm doin'</i>

00:09:02.899 --> 00:09:04.799
<i>♪ I got a feeling</i>

00:09:04.801 --> 00:09:09.706
<i>♪ I should be doin' all right</i>

00:09:12.009 --> 00:09:15.609
<i>♪ Doin' all right ♪</i>

00:09:19.215 --> 00:09:21.650
I was born with
four additional incisors.

00:09:21.652 --> 00:09:24.551
More space in my mouth
means more range.

00:09:24.553 --> 00:09:26.756
I'll consider your offer.

00:09:32.261 --> 00:09:33.296
Uh, do you play bass?

00:09:34.664 --> 00:09:35.932
Nope.

00:09:50.147 --> 00:09:51.982
Excuse me. Thanks.

00:09:54.918 --> 00:09:56.550
So, you found me, then.

00:09:56.552 --> 00:09:58.386
- How can I help you?
- Oh.

00:09:58.388 --> 00:10:00.188
Um, I rather liked these.

00:10:00.190 --> 00:10:02.391
Do you think
you have them in my size?

00:10:02.393 --> 00:10:05.428
This is the ladies' section,
so I'm not exactly sure.

00:10:06.964 --> 00:10:09.033
There wasn't a sign
or anything.

00:10:10.299 --> 00:10:12.902
I don't think it should
really matter, do you?

00:10:19.942 --> 00:10:22.045
I thought
you might like this.

00:10:22.946 --> 00:10:24.879
Are you even allowed
to be in here?

00:10:24.881 --> 00:10:26.082
No, not really.

00:10:32.188 --> 00:10:33.490
One more thing.

00:10:34.691 --> 00:10:35.960
May I?

00:10:46.836 --> 00:10:49.173
You have such
an exotic look.

00:10:50.908 --> 00:10:52.143
I love your style.

00:10:53.543 --> 00:10:55.545
I think we should all
take more risks.

00:11:10.193 --> 00:11:11.861
What do you think?

00:11:17.033 --> 00:11:18.568
Oh, cheers.
Thank you.

00:11:19.802 --> 00:11:20.868
<i>Hello, everybody.</i>

00:11:22.172 --> 00:11:25.172
<i>We've got a few fresh faces.</i>

00:11:25.174 --> 00:11:27.342
<i>This is John Deacon,
our bass player.</i>

00:11:27.344 --> 00:11:29.676
<i>Yeah, and
our new lead singer...</i>

00:11:29.678 --> 00:11:31.945
<i>Freddie Bul... Bulsara...</i>

00:11:31.947 --> 00:11:33.449
<i>Freddie Bulsara.</i>

00:11:33.917 --> 00:11:35.383
That's right.

00:11:35.385 --> 00:11:38.052
<i>And Roger, of course.</i> The
biggest member <i>of them all.</i>

00:11:38.054 --> 00:11:39.521
Hey, Roger!

00:11:39.523 --> 00:11:42.326
<i>Hello,
all you beautiful people.</i>

00:11:44.693 --> 00:11:46.496
Where's Tim?

00:11:47.230 --> 00:11:48.897
Who's the Pakkie?

00:11:48.899 --> 00:11:50.333
Ready, Freddie?

00:11:51.234 --> 00:11:52.235
Let's do it.

00:12:15.125 --> 00:12:16.493
<i>♪ Keep yourself alive</i>

00:12:33.376 --> 00:12:37.244
<i>♪ I was told a million times

00:12:37.246 --> 00:12:40.681

00:12:44.486 --> 00:12:46.054
- <i>♪ Still be where I started</i>
- Wrong lyric!

00:12:46.056 --> 00:12:48.022
- <i>♪ Bread and butter for a smile</i>
- Wrong lyric.

00:12:48.024 --> 00:12:51.258
<i>♪ Sold a million mirrors

00:12:51.260 --> 00:12:54.494

<i>♪ All you people

00:13:10.980 --> 00:13:12.283
Learn the song, Freddie.

00:13:43.813 --> 00:13:45.048
You're late.

00:13:50.220 --> 00:13:51.552
This is bollocks!

00:13:55.658 --> 00:13:58.859
It's counterclockwise,
I think you'll find, John.

00:13:58.861 --> 00:14:00.462
Oh, is it?
Thank you, Brian.

00:14:00.464 --> 00:14:02.262
Would you like to do it?
Please, feel free.

00:14:02.264 --> 00:14:03.565
No, no, no.
Doing a good job.

00:14:03.567 --> 00:14:06.533
We sold out every pub and uni
south of Glasgow...

00:14:06.535 --> 00:14:08.603
and I'm stuck
in the middle of nowhere,

00:14:08.605 --> 00:14:09.704
eating a ham sandwich!

00:14:09.706 --> 00:14:12.206
Trouble is, we're just not
thinking big enough.

00:14:12.208 --> 00:14:13.775
What have you
got in mind, Fred?

00:14:13.777 --> 00:14:14.842
An album.

00:14:14.844 --> 00:14:16.810
We can't afford an album.

00:14:16.812 --> 00:14:18.514
Oh, we'll find a way.

00:14:20.350 --> 00:14:22.319
How much do you think
we can get for this van?

00:14:23.953 --> 00:14:25.989
I hope you're joking.

00:14:28.124 --> 00:14:29.657
That's three months' wages.

00:14:29.659 --> 00:14:30.925
And a perfectly good van.

00:14:30.927 --> 00:14:32.560
Don't be so dramatic,
darling.

00:14:32.562 --> 00:14:35.666
You're recording
an album tonight. Let's go!

00:14:42.773 --> 00:14:43.905
Don't you think
I sound like shit?

00:14:43.907 --> 00:14:45.138
No, it's good.

00:14:45.140 --> 00:14:47.310
- Can we try it again?
- Sure, yeah.

00:14:47.977 --> 00:14:49.278
Sure, it's your money.

00:14:49.712 --> 00:14:50.877
Literally.

00:15:00.923 --> 00:15:01.988
Sounds a lot better.

00:15:01.990 --> 00:15:03.559
We need to
get experimental.

00:15:05.294 --> 00:15:08.131
Try bouncing us left and right
for the ah-ah-ahs.

00:15:15.071 --> 00:15:16.871
Now dead center for the last.

00:15:16.873 --> 00:15:18.406
And then blast it!

00:15:18.408 --> 00:15:19.473
Yes!

00:15:26.082 --> 00:15:27.283
That's good, right?

00:15:30.552 --> 00:15:32.219
Do we have time
to stack a few more?

00:15:32.221 --> 00:15:35.158
The studio opens at 8:00,
so we got 30 more minutes.

00:15:40.563 --> 00:15:41.564
Hmm.

00:15:45.368 --> 00:15:46.703
- That sounds good, right?
- Yeah.

00:15:55.477 --> 00:15:57.445
Oi, RT, who are these kids
in the box?

00:15:57.447 --> 00:16:01.415
A student band
doing some weird stuff.

00:16:01.417 --> 00:16:02.916
How about demos?
You got some?

00:16:02.918 --> 00:16:04.554
Been up all night,
mate.

00:16:15.331 --> 00:16:17.398
So the new name is Queen?

00:16:17.400 --> 00:16:19.065
As in "Her Royal Highness."

00:16:19.067 --> 00:16:20.768
And because
it's outrageous...

00:16:20.770 --> 00:16:23.806
and I can't think of anyone
more outrageous than me.

00:16:30.312 --> 00:16:34.283
This is the most
impractical bed.

00:16:45.294 --> 00:16:47.163
That's beautiful.

00:16:59.842 --> 00:17:01.844
Think it has potential.

00:17:11.654 --> 00:17:14.154
- I have to go to work.
- I simply won't allow it.

00:17:14.156 --> 00:17:16.159
You're going to support me
if I get fired?

00:17:17.227 --> 00:17:19.427
I'll always
look after you.

00:17:19.429 --> 00:17:20.961
I'm going to...

00:17:20.963 --> 00:17:22.566
I'm going to be late.

00:17:34.711 --> 00:17:36.279
How beautiful you are.

00:17:46.256 --> 00:17:47.421
When I was a little girl...

00:17:47.423 --> 00:17:51.226
I used to run around the house
and hide and...

00:17:51.228 --> 00:17:52.429
he couldn't find me.

00:17:54.063 --> 00:17:55.265
Clever girl.

00:17:56.699 --> 00:17:58.032
Please tell your father
it's nice to meet him.

00:17:58.034 --> 00:17:59.234
I have.

00:17:59.236 --> 00:18:01.936
Then thank him
for the lovely birthday cake.

00:18:01.938 --> 00:18:03.738
I have.

00:18:03.740 --> 00:18:06.943
Then tell him his daughter's
an epic shag.

00:18:08.009 --> 00:18:10.346
Freddie,
he can read lips.

00:18:11.580 --> 00:18:12.680
Mary...

00:18:12.682 --> 00:18:15.382
I can't tell you how long
I have waited for Farrokh...

00:18:15.384 --> 00:18:17.151
to bring home
a nice girl like you.

00:18:17.153 --> 00:18:18.353
Farrokh?

00:18:18.355 --> 00:18:20.888
Did Farrokh not tell you
he was born in Zanzibar?

00:18:20.890 --> 00:18:23.157
- No, he did not.
- I used to know a girl

00:18:23.159 --> 00:18:24.525
- who was Zanzibari.
- One minute.

00:18:24.527 --> 00:18:26.459
I thought Freddie
was born in London.

00:18:26.461 --> 00:18:28.997
- Oh, he was. At the age of 18.
- Shut up.

00:18:28.999 --> 00:18:30.832
Our family is
Indian Parsee.

00:18:30.834 --> 00:18:32.600
- Mum. Mum, Mum.
- Mary...

00:18:32.602 --> 00:18:33.934
- Mum.
- Mum, please...

00:18:33.936 --> 00:18:35.201
Here. Have a look at these.

00:18:35.203 --> 00:18:36.571
- Yes. Yeah.
- Please! Please.

00:18:36.573 --> 00:18:38.242
- No stopping.
- We need to see those.

00:18:38.775 --> 00:18:40.173
A thousand years ago,

00:18:40.175 --> 00:18:42.642
the Parsees fled to India
from Persia...

00:18:42.644 --> 00:18:44.277
to escape Muslim persecution.

00:18:44.279 --> 00:18:46.479
Really?
That's terrible.

00:18:46.481 --> 00:18:48.015
So why did you
leave Zanzibar?

00:18:48.017 --> 00:18:49.217
We didn't leave.

00:18:49.219 --> 00:18:50.584
He's so small.

00:18:50.586 --> 00:18:52.486
We were chased out with just
the clothes on our backs.

00:18:52.488 --> 00:18:54.521
He was quite a good boxer,
actually.

00:18:55.791 --> 00:18:57.092
He had to be.

00:18:57.094 --> 00:18:58.191
His opponents
went for his teeth

00:18:58.193 --> 00:18:59.492
always trying to
punch them in.

00:18:59.494 --> 00:19:01.595
Certainly a target.

00:19:01.597 --> 00:19:04.298
So how old is he
in this photo?

00:19:04.300 --> 00:19:05.466
I think three
or four years old.

00:19:05.468 --> 00:19:06.467
Really?
Boxing already at that age?

00:19:06.469 --> 00:19:07.735
So good.

00:19:10.272 --> 00:19:11.474
Mercury?

00:19:12.107 --> 00:19:13.309
No looking back.

00:19:13.876 --> 00:19:14.942
Only forward.

00:19:14.944 --> 00:19:17.076
So now the family name's
not good enough for you?

00:19:17.078 --> 00:19:18.846
It's just a stage name.

00:19:18.848 --> 00:19:20.817
No, it's not.

00:19:21.984 --> 00:19:23.351
I changed it legally.

00:19:23.353 --> 00:19:25.555
Got a new passport
and everything.

00:19:27.190 --> 00:19:29.055
Kash, how old are you here?

00:19:29.057 --> 00:19:30.290
I don't know.

00:19:30.292 --> 00:19:31.659
It was before Freddie went off
to boarding school.

00:19:31.661 --> 00:19:34.429
I sent Farrokh away to make
a good Parsee boy of him.

00:19:34.431 --> 00:19:35.930
He was too wild and unruly.

00:19:35.932 --> 00:19:37.230
But what good did it do?

00:19:37.232 --> 00:19:40.234
Good thoughts,
good words, good deeds.

00:19:42.838 --> 00:19:43.703
You can't get anywhere

00:19:43.705 --> 00:19:45.038
pretending to be
someone you're not.

00:19:45.040 --> 00:19:46.676
Who'd like some cake?

00:19:47.509 --> 00:19:49.276
Cake is always good.

00:19:49.278 --> 00:19:50.344
Hello?

00:19:50.346 --> 00:19:51.845
Just a moment.

00:19:51.847 --> 00:19:52.848
Freddie Mercury.

00:19:53.816 --> 00:19:54.815
Phone call.

00:19:54.817 --> 00:19:56.517
Quite like
the sound of that.

00:19:56.519 --> 00:19:59.586
Freddie tells me that you're
some sort of a scientist.

00:19:59.588 --> 00:20:01.389
- Astrophysics, actually.
- Oh.

00:20:01.391 --> 00:20:02.657
Yeah, my father would've
preferred it if I continued.

00:20:02.659 --> 00:20:03.923
- When?
- That's very clever.

00:20:03.925 --> 00:20:06.059
- He's a dentist.
- I was never a dentist.

00:20:06.061 --> 00:20:07.128
That's a picture
I want to see.

00:20:07.130 --> 00:20:08.332
He's a dentist.

00:20:09.566 --> 00:20:10.764
I see.

00:20:10.766 --> 00:20:12.232
That's also quite clever,
actually.

00:20:12.234 --> 00:20:13.601
Kash...

00:20:13.603 --> 00:20:15.135
what are you doing later?

00:20:15.137 --> 00:20:16.370
Homework.

00:20:20.076 --> 00:20:21.209
Just making conversation.

00:20:21.211 --> 00:20:22.343
What kind of music

00:20:22.345 --> 00:20:23.710
was he listening to
back in those days?

00:20:23.712 --> 00:20:26.450
Uh, he was listening to
Little Richard.

00:20:27.717 --> 00:20:30.183
- Very good.
- Richard, yeah.

00:20:30.185 --> 00:20:32.151
And his first band...

00:20:32.153 --> 00:20:33.457
I have an announcement.

00:20:36.558 --> 00:20:39.125
One of the A&R men...

00:20:39.127 --> 00:20:41.495
from EMI saw us recording.

00:20:41.497 --> 00:20:43.467
Gave our demo
to John Reid.

00:20:44.401 --> 00:20:46.299
He looks after Elton John.

00:20:46.301 --> 00:20:47.500
Oh, my God.

00:20:47.502 --> 00:20:48.704
Mr. Reid wants to meet us...

00:20:49.471 --> 00:20:51.471
and possibly, even manage us.

00:20:51.473 --> 00:20:53.039
- Shut up.
- You're joking!

00:20:53.041 --> 00:20:55.044
Oh, my God!

00:21:03.286 --> 00:21:04.552
You're sure
he said 12 o'clock?

00:21:04.554 --> 00:21:06.386
Yes. "Midday at
the pub, don't be drunk."

00:21:06.388 --> 00:21:07.453
That's what he said.

00:21:07.455 --> 00:21:08.521
You look
a bit nervous, Brian.

00:21:08.523 --> 00:21:09.590
John, I'm fine.

00:21:09.592 --> 00:21:10.724
You're usually
so particular.

00:21:10.726 --> 00:21:11.793
You just gotta be cool.

00:21:11.795 --> 00:21:13.827
- Wow!
- Wanker.

00:21:13.829 --> 00:21:15.696
I didn't know
it was fancy dress, Fred.

00:21:15.698 --> 00:21:17.498
I've gotta make
an impression, darling.

00:21:17.500 --> 00:21:19.100
You look like
an angry lizard.

00:21:20.068 --> 00:21:22.469
- It's your best work.
- Very subtle.

00:21:22.471 --> 00:21:23.740
You gonna fly away?

00:21:25.275 --> 00:21:27.411
Can I borrow it
for Sunday church?

00:21:36.586 --> 00:21:38.753
So, this is Queen.

00:21:38.755 --> 00:21:42.122
And you must be
Freddie Mercury.

00:21:42.124 --> 00:21:43.423
You've got a gift.

00:21:43.425 --> 00:21:45.160
You all have.

00:21:45.162 --> 00:21:46.259
So tell me...

00:21:46.261 --> 00:21:47.461
what makes Queen
any different

00:21:47.463 --> 00:21:50.567
from all the other
wannabe rock stars I meet?

00:21:51.634 --> 00:21:54.134
I'll tell you what it is.

00:21:54.136 --> 00:21:56.603
We're four misfits
who don't belong together,

00:21:56.605 --> 00:21:58.439
playing to the other misfits.

00:21:58.441 --> 00:22:00.740
The outcasts right at the back
of the room...

00:22:00.742 --> 00:22:03.046
who are pretty sure
they don't belong either.

00:22:04.212 --> 00:22:06.081
We belong to them.

00:22:07.083 --> 00:22:08.482
We're a family.

00:22:08.484 --> 00:22:10.052
But no two of us
are the same.

00:22:11.820 --> 00:22:13.120
Paul.

00:22:13.122 --> 00:22:14.521
Paul Prenter...

00:22:14.523 --> 00:22:16.891
meet Queen...

00:22:16.893 --> 00:22:18.092
our new signing.

00:22:18.094 --> 00:22:20.361
Paul will be looking after
your day-to-day.

00:22:20.363 --> 00:22:21.429
Pleasure.

00:22:21.431 --> 00:22:22.662
If I can get you
on the radio...

00:22:22.664 --> 00:22:24.565
maybe I can get you
on television.

00:22:24.567 --> 00:22:26.767
- <i>Top of the Pops?</i>
- Hopefully.

00:22:26.769 --> 00:22:27.834
And then?

00:22:27.836 --> 00:22:28.702
And then...

00:22:28.704 --> 00:22:29.769
it's only the biggest

00:22:29.771 --> 00:22:30.872
television program
in the country.

00:22:30.874 --> 00:22:32.506
No one's ever even
heard of you.

00:22:32.508 --> 00:22:34.475
Look, I admire
your enthusiasm.

00:22:34.477 --> 00:22:36.177
If it goes well,
if it happens...

00:22:36.179 --> 00:22:39.649
I've got a promotional tour
of Japan in mind.

00:22:40.884 --> 00:22:42.315
We'll want more.

00:22:42.317 --> 00:22:43.584
Every band wants more.

00:22:43.586 --> 00:22:45.689
Every band's not Queen.

00:22:50.259 --> 00:22:51.558
- Listen, I understand.
- Hurry up.

00:22:51.560 --> 00:22:53.026
I understand that
it's the policy of the BBC.

00:22:53.028 --> 00:22:54.728
- We have procedures.
- This is shit!

00:22:54.730 --> 00:22:56.596
I need you to explain it
to the band, please.

00:22:56.598 --> 00:22:58.032
- Okay, let's make it quick.
- Freddie, boys.

00:22:58.034 --> 00:23:00.567
Look, chaps,
it is going to be playback.

00:23:00.569 --> 00:23:01.701
Lip synch's
all that's required.

00:23:01.703 --> 00:23:03.403
We do know how to
play our instruments.

00:23:03.405 --> 00:23:04.972
You want me to lip synch?

00:23:04.974 --> 00:23:07.374
I don't understand why
we can't simply perform live.

00:23:07.376 --> 00:23:08.942
The audience will never know
the difference.

00:23:08.944 --> 00:23:10.443
We'll know
the bloody difference.

00:23:10.445 --> 00:23:11.746
This is the BBC.

00:23:11.748 --> 00:23:13.247
That's how things are done
around here. All right?

00:23:13.249 --> 00:23:14.750
Don't be a nuisance.

00:23:15.617 --> 00:23:17.520
Freddie, it'll be great.

00:23:19.087 --> 00:23:22.390
You'll just have to make sure
no one's looking at your lips.

00:23:22.392 --> 00:23:23.623
Well,
the way things are done

00:23:23.625 --> 00:23:25.293
are a load of bollocks,
old chap.

00:23:25.295 --> 00:23:26.526
This is the BBC.

00:23:26.528 --> 00:23:28.228
I'm relieved.

00:23:28.230 --> 00:23:29.563
You would be.

00:23:29.565 --> 00:23:30.765
Perfect performance.

00:23:31.968 --> 00:23:34.535

No one wants to see this

00:23:56.858 --> 00:23:59.159

What was it like singing
for all those people?

00:24:23.353 --> 00:24:25.355
When I know
they're listening...

00:24:26.455 --> 00:24:28.791
when I know
I really have them...

00:24:29.692 --> 00:24:32.628
I couldn't sing off-key
if I tried.

00:24:34.263 --> 00:24:38.701
I'm exactly the person
I was always meant to be.

00:24:40.769 --> 00:24:43.006
I'm not afraid of anything.

00:24:49.144 --> 00:24:51.277
The only other time
I ever feel that way

00:24:51.279 --> 00:24:52.682
is when I'm with you.

00:25:03.392 --> 00:25:04.894
Don't move.

00:25:08.230 --> 00:25:09.633
Don't move.

00:25:22.411 --> 00:25:24.648
You're the love of my life.

00:25:36.925 --> 00:25:38.093
Freddie.

00:25:44.733 --> 00:25:46.801
Which finger
do I put this on?

00:25:49.204 --> 00:25:51.138
Wedding finger.

00:25:51.140 --> 00:25:52.809
Will you marry me?

00:26:01.550 --> 00:26:02.951
Yes!

00:26:05.855 --> 00:26:07.488
Are you gonna leave it
in the box?

00:26:12.260 --> 00:26:14.461
Freddie, it's beautiful.

00:26:14.463 --> 00:26:15.796
I love it.

00:26:15.798 --> 00:26:18.165
Promise me
you'll never take it off.

00:26:18.167 --> 00:26:20.101
Oh, I promise.

00:26:20.103 --> 00:26:21.669
No matter what.

00:26:21.671 --> 00:26:23.970
I love you, Freddie.

00:26:23.972 --> 00:26:27.040
You're going to do
such great things.

00:26:27.042 --> 00:26:29.078
We're going to do
great things.

00:26:32.582 --> 00:26:33.983
Your phone's
off the hook.

00:26:34.450 --> 00:26:35.515
This is Crystal.

00:26:35.517 --> 00:26:36.583
Cheryl!

00:26:36.585 --> 00:26:37.718
Oh, that's right.
My mistake.

00:26:37.720 --> 00:26:38.952
Where's your loo?

00:26:38.954 --> 00:26:41.521
Uh, just down the hall.

00:26:41.523 --> 00:26:43.591
Oh, come on in.
Make yourselves at home.

00:26:43.593 --> 00:26:44.758
Don't mind us.

00:26:44.760 --> 00:26:46.892
Hello, Mary.
How's your dad?

00:26:46.894 --> 00:26:48.228
Yeah, pretty well.
Thanks.

00:26:48.230 --> 00:26:49.529
- Good.
- What's going on, Brian?

00:26:49.531 --> 00:26:52.032
Well, if you'd answered your
phone, you'd know already.

00:26:52.034 --> 00:26:54.270
This really isn't
a good time, guys.

00:26:55.971 --> 00:26:57.939
John Reid called today.

00:26:57.941 --> 00:27:00.507
He has a little tour
in mind for us.

00:27:00.509 --> 00:27:02.112
It's not little,
Brian.

00:27:03.578 --> 00:27:05.815
He's booked us a tour
of America.

00:27:08.684 --> 00:27:10.986
The album's hit the charts
in the U.S.!

00:27:12.421 --> 00:27:13.523
Oh, yes!

00:27:16.425 --> 00:27:18.093
Yes!

00:27:19.060 --> 00:27:20.494
Yes!

00:27:21.830 --> 00:27:23.031
It's happening!

00:27:28.104 --> 00:27:30.837
<i>Now, who wants to take a ride?</i>

00:28:00.303 --> 00:28:01.905
<i>We love you, Cleveland!</i>

00:28:02.771 --> 00:28:04.807
<i>We love you, Houston!</i>

00:28:05.773 --> 00:28:07.843
<i>We love you, Denver!
Very happy to be here!</i>

00:28:11.780 --> 00:28:12.946
<i>And are the crowds big?</i>

00:28:12.948 --> 00:28:14.280
Well, we're selling out
every night.

00:28:14.282 --> 00:28:15.882
I just wish you were here
to see it.

00:28:15.884 --> 00:28:17.487
<i>They really love us.</i>

00:28:19.321 --> 00:28:21.223
<i>We love you, Portland!</i>

00:28:24.759 --> 00:28:26.927
<i>He's got a big ass, too!</i>

00:28:26.929 --> 00:28:28.865
<i>We love you, New Orleans!</i>

00:28:32.734 --> 00:28:34.903
<i>We love you, Atlanta!</i>

00:28:39.275 --> 00:28:40.874
<i>Rog, come down here
and say hello.</i>

00:28:40.876 --> 00:28:42.742
<i>We love you, Pittsburgh!</i>

00:28:42.744 --> 00:28:45.011
- Roger!
- <i>Now, hit it!</i>

00:28:45.013 --> 00:28:46.680
<i>I'm good.
I just miss you.</i>

00:28:46.682 --> 00:28:47.914
What are you doing?

00:28:47.916 --> 00:28:49.882
You can't possibly be having
any fun without me.

00:28:49.884 --> 00:28:51.921
<i>Nothing as exciting
as America.</i>

00:29:04.133 --> 00:29:05.634
Say hi to the boys for me.

00:29:06.769 --> 00:29:08.902
I will. Love you.

00:29:08.904 --> 00:29:10.405
Bye, Freddie. I love you.

00:30:08.596 --> 00:30:10.032
Hello.

00:30:11.099 --> 00:30:12.866
- You're late.
- Am I?

00:30:12.868 --> 00:30:14.501
We saved you a seat.

00:30:14.503 --> 00:30:15.669
- Lovely.
- Okay.

00:30:15.671 --> 00:30:17.036
So, now that
we're all here...

00:30:17.038 --> 00:30:19.006
Jim, this is Ray Foster.

00:30:19.008 --> 00:30:20.908
Ray, this is the
band's lawyer, Jim Beach.

00:30:20.910 --> 00:30:21.976
Hello.

00:30:21.978 --> 00:30:23.376
You must stop
calling him that.

00:30:23.378 --> 00:30:24.277
That's his name.

00:30:24.279 --> 00:30:27.113
No, we cannot keep
calling him "Jim Beach."

00:30:27.115 --> 00:30:30.653
No, that's absurd, not to
mention, unspeakably boring.

00:30:33.055 --> 00:30:34.822
Miami.

00:30:34.824 --> 00:30:38.094
From now on,
I dub thee "Miami Beach."

00:30:39.327 --> 00:30:41.562
The sun always sets
behind you, doesn't it?

00:30:41.564 --> 00:30:42.966
On Miami Beach.

00:30:44.833 --> 00:30:46.065
Hmm, right.

00:30:46.067 --> 00:30:48.267
Now that everybody's
got an acceptable name...

00:30:48.269 --> 00:30:50.171
let's get to it.
Look...

00:30:50.173 --> 00:30:52.342
we just really need
something special.

00:30:53.276 --> 00:30:54.574
More hits...

00:30:54.576 --> 00:30:55.711
like <i>Killer Queen...</i>

00:30:56.278 --> 00:30:57.276
only bigger.

00:30:57.278 --> 00:30:58.978
It's not bloody widgets
we're making.

00:30:58.980 --> 00:31:01.217
We can't just
reproduce <i>Killer Queen.</i>

00:31:01.817 --> 00:31:03.385
No.

00:31:04.819 --> 00:31:06.355
We can do better.

00:31:16.565 --> 00:31:17.898
It's opera.

00:31:17.900 --> 00:31:19.932
- Opera!
- Opera!

00:31:19.934 --> 00:31:21.269
There seems to be
an echo in here.

00:31:51.099 --> 00:31:53.499
See, we don't want to
repeat ourselves.

00:31:53.501 --> 00:31:55.568
The same formula
over and over.

00:31:55.570 --> 00:31:59.005
Formulas are a complete
and utter waste of time.

00:31:59.007 --> 00:32:00.340
Formulas work.

00:32:00.342 --> 00:32:01.941
Let's stick
with the formulas.

00:32:01.943 --> 00:32:03.075
I like formulas.

00:32:03.077 --> 00:32:04.780
We'll call the album...

00:32:05.580 --> 00:32:08.248
<i>A Night at the Opera.</i>

00:32:08.250 --> 00:32:12.018
Are you aware that no one
actually likes opera?

00:32:12.020 --> 00:32:13.255
I like opera.

00:32:14.022 --> 00:32:16.088
- Do you?
- I do.

00:32:16.090 --> 00:32:17.856
No, don't
misunderstand, darling.

00:32:17.858 --> 00:32:19.793
It's a rock and roll record...

00:32:19.795 --> 00:32:21.094
with the scale of opera...

00:32:21.096 --> 00:32:23.130
the pathos of Greek tragedy...

00:32:23.132 --> 00:32:25.399
the wit of Shakespeare...

00:32:25.401 --> 00:32:29.436
the unbridled joy
of musical theater.

00:32:29.438 --> 00:32:31.838
- It's a musical experience.
- Yeah.

00:32:31.840 --> 00:32:33.940
Rather than just
another record.

00:32:33.942 --> 00:32:36.042
Something for everyone...

00:32:36.044 --> 00:32:37.280
something...

00:32:38.446 --> 00:32:39.513
Hmm.

00:32:39.515 --> 00:32:42.181
Something that will make
people feel belongs to them.

00:32:42.183 --> 00:32:44.686
We'll mix genres,
we'll cross boundaries...

00:32:46.588 --> 00:32:49.488
we'll speak in bloody tongues
if we want to.

00:32:49.490 --> 00:32:51.557
There's no musical ghetto
that can contain us.

00:32:51.559 --> 00:32:53.360
- That's it.
- No one knows what Queen means

00:32:53.362 --> 00:32:55.631
because it doesn't mean
one thing.

00:32:58.866 --> 00:33:00.168
What do you think, John?

00:33:00.536 --> 00:33:01.637
I...

00:33:02.238 --> 00:33:03.536
agree with the band.

00:33:03.538 --> 00:33:04.640
Of course you do.

00:33:06.208 --> 00:33:07.874
How about you, uh...

00:33:07.876 --> 00:33:10.343
- Miami.
- Hmm.

00:33:10.345 --> 00:33:11.881
Fortune favors the bold.

00:33:13.682 --> 00:33:15.284
Surely, a man of your...

00:33:16.751 --> 00:33:18.285
unique taste...

00:33:18.287 --> 00:33:20.590
isn't afraid
of a little risk?

00:33:23.058 --> 00:33:24.826
Please don't make me
regret this.

00:33:25.994 --> 00:33:27.562
You're fun.

00:33:38.906 --> 00:33:40.876
Recording studio?

00:33:42.577 --> 00:33:45.615
Well, the idea was to get away
from all distractions.

00:33:46.883 --> 00:33:49.684
Right, I know it's not
the Ritz. Not even close.

00:33:50.619 --> 00:33:53.018
- Roger, you're in here.
- Right.

00:33:53.020 --> 00:33:55.324
Freddie, this is you.
Biggest room.

00:33:55.856 --> 00:33:57.857
Brian, that's you.

00:33:57.859 --> 00:34:00.228
John, you're downstairs.

00:34:06.602 --> 00:34:07.769
And...

00:34:08.903 --> 00:34:11.237
this is all yours, John.

00:34:11.239 --> 00:34:13.675
Smaller rooms
don't get nearly as cold.

00:34:15.811 --> 00:34:17.246
Okay.

00:34:36.699 --> 00:34:37.700
Hmm.

00:34:47.007 --> 00:34:49.344
Oh, that's really good.

00:35:04.458 --> 00:35:09.565
<i>♪ Love of my
life, you've hurt me</i>

00:35:11.132 --> 00:35:15.300
<i>♪ You've broken my heart</i>

00:35:15.302 --> 00:35:21.911
<i>♪ And now you leave me</i>

00:35:23.144 --> 00:35:27.817
<i>♪ Love of my life,
can't you see?</i>

00:35:29.384 --> 00:35:33.588
<i>♪ Bring it back, bring it back</i>

00:35:34.456 --> 00:35:37.023
<i>♪ Bring it back,
bring it back</i>

00:35:37.025 --> 00:35:41.228
<i>♪ Don't take it away from me</i>

00:35:41.230 --> 00:35:45.467
<i>♪ Because you don't know</i>

00:35:46.601 --> 00:35:50.539
<i>♪ What it means to me ♪</i>

00:35:53.809 --> 00:35:54.810
Hmm.

00:36:00.048 --> 00:36:01.449
It's beautiful.

00:36:07.956 --> 00:36:08.958
What's it called?

00:36:10.525 --> 00:36:13.429
<i>Love of My Life.</i>
I wrote it for Mary.

00:36:14.063 --> 00:36:15.398
If you say so.

00:36:56.170 --> 00:36:58.540
Don't misunderstand, Paul.

00:37:00.141 --> 00:37:03.411
Mary knows me in a way
that no one else ever will.

00:37:06.681 --> 00:37:08.548
I know you, Freddie Mercury.

00:37:08.550 --> 00:37:10.483
Is that what you think?

00:37:10.485 --> 00:37:13.253
Oh, no, you don't know me.

00:37:13.255 --> 00:37:15.789
You just see
what you want to see.

00:37:15.791 --> 00:37:18.394
We work together.
That's all.

00:37:25.967 --> 00:37:28.101
I put my heart and soul
into this song.

00:37:28.103 --> 00:37:29.369
No one is disputing that.

00:37:29.371 --> 00:37:30.436
And you don't like it

00:37:30.438 --> 00:37:31.804
because you want
your songs on the album!

00:37:31.806 --> 00:37:34.340
- It's not that, Roger.
- Then what is it?

00:37:34.342 --> 00:37:36.778
<i>I'm in Love with My Car.</i>

00:37:38.079 --> 00:37:39.646
Maybe it's not
strong enough?

00:37:39.648 --> 00:37:41.248
What does that even
mean, "not strong enough"?

00:37:41.250 --> 00:37:43.150
I know I'm late.
What did I miss?

00:37:43.152 --> 00:37:44.450
Discussing Roger's
car song.

00:37:44.452 --> 00:37:46.385
Is it strong enough?
That's all I'm asking.

00:37:46.387 --> 00:37:48.655
If I'm on my own here,
then I apologize.

00:37:48.657 --> 00:37:50.960
How does your new song go,
then, hmm?

00:37:53.295 --> 00:37:54.726
"You call me sweet...

00:37:54.728 --> 00:37:56.865
"like I'm some
kind of cheese."

00:37:57.565 --> 00:37:59.566
- It's good.
- Wow.

00:37:59.568 --> 00:38:01.568
"When my hand's
on your grease gun..."

00:38:01.570 --> 00:38:02.936
That's very subtle,
isn't it?

00:38:02.938 --> 00:38:04.070
It's a metaphor, Brian.

00:38:04.072 --> 00:38:05.005
It's just a bit weird,
Roger.

00:38:05.007 --> 00:38:07.706
What exactly are you doing
with that car?

00:38:07.708 --> 00:38:09.208
Children, please.

00:38:09.210 --> 00:38:10.476
We could all
murder each other...

00:38:10.478 --> 00:38:12.112
but then who would be left
to record this album?

00:38:12.114 --> 00:38:14.113
Statistically speaking,
most bands don't fail,

00:38:14.115 --> 00:38:15.815
they break up.

00:38:15.817 --> 00:38:17.920
Why the hell would
you say something like that?

00:38:18.887 --> 00:38:20.454
Roger, there's only room
in this band

00:38:20.456 --> 00:38:21.753
for one hysterical queen.

00:38:21.755 --> 00:38:23.824
You know why
you're angry, Roger?

00:38:23.826 --> 00:38:24.791
Why?

00:38:24.793 --> 00:38:27.061
'Cause you know your song
isn't strong enough.

00:38:30.199 --> 00:38:32.134
- Not...
- Is that strong enough?

00:38:33.202 --> 00:38:34.534
What about that?

00:38:34.536 --> 00:38:36.672
Not the coffee machine!

00:39:12.173 --> 00:39:15.041
<i>♪ Goodbye, everybody</i>

00:39:15.043 --> 00:39:18.445
<i>♪ I've got to go</i>

00:39:18.447 --> 00:39:25.552
<i>♪ Gotta leave you all behind
and face the truth</i>

00:39:25.554 --> 00:39:31.594
<i>♪ Mama
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh</i>

00:39:32.293 --> 00:39:35.595
<i>♪ I don't wanna die</i>

00:39:35.597 --> 00:39:41.269
<i>♪ I sometimes wish
I'd never been born at all ♪</i>

00:40:14.536 --> 00:40:16.269
<i>What next?</i>

00:40:16.271 --> 00:40:17.503
That was pretty damn good.

00:40:17.505 --> 00:40:19.838
Brilliant.
I love that.

00:40:19.840 --> 00:40:21.208
<i>Press the button, Freddie.</i>

00:40:21.210 --> 00:40:22.775
I know,
I know where it is.

00:40:22.777 --> 00:40:24.409
I know where...
Knock, knock.

00:40:24.411 --> 00:40:25.545
Good.

00:40:25.547 --> 00:40:26.878
<i>It's good. Um...</i>

00:40:26.880 --> 00:40:29.449
You know,
play it like you wrote it.

00:40:29.451 --> 00:40:30.853
<i>Well, I did.
I wrote that part.</i>

00:40:31.385 --> 00:40:32.519
Taking the piss.

00:40:32.521 --> 00:40:33.822
<i>Okay. Are you happy?</i>

00:40:34.556 --> 00:40:36.188
I think it's beautiful.

00:40:36.190 --> 00:40:37.657
<i>It's almost perfect.</i>

00:40:37.659 --> 00:40:38.860
<i>Almost?</i>

00:40:39.594 --> 00:40:41.427
Yes, give it
more rock and roll.

00:40:41.429 --> 00:40:42.862
<i>I'm always up for that, Fred.</i>

00:40:42.864 --> 00:40:44.430
<i>Put your body into it.</i>

00:40:44.432 --> 00:40:45.498
<i>Right. Okay.</i>

00:40:45.500 --> 00:40:46.633
<i>Put my body into it.
I got it.</i>

00:40:46.635 --> 00:40:47.833
Not like that.

00:40:47.835 --> 00:40:49.334
<i>No, I got it. I got it.
Bit more soul, yeah?</i>

00:40:49.336 --> 00:40:50.637
All right.
Give it more heart.

00:40:50.639 --> 00:40:52.104
<i>I'll do that. We good to go?</i>

00:40:52.106 --> 00:40:53.072
<i>Roy, you good?</i>

00:40:53.074 --> 00:40:55.711
Oh, and then there's
the operatic section.

00:40:58.079 --> 00:40:59.445
You're gonna love it.

00:40:59.447 --> 00:41:01.414
The operatic section?

00:41:01.416 --> 00:41:03.717
- I know, it sounds crazy.
- I love it, Fred. I love it.

00:41:03.719 --> 00:41:05.050
<i>I don't know.
It could be a flop.</i>

00:41:05.052 --> 00:41:06.318
- <i>It could work.</i>
- I love it!

00:41:07.521 --> 00:41:09.054
<i>What have we got to lose?</i>

00:41:09.056 --> 00:41:10.590
Nothing.

00:41:10.592 --> 00:41:12.025
If you say so.

00:41:12.027 --> 00:41:13.193
Okay, let's go.

00:41:13.195 --> 00:41:14.260
Deacy.

00:41:28.809 --> 00:41:30.508
<i>How was that?</i>

00:41:30.510 --> 00:41:32.748
- Freddie?
- Higher.

00:41:34.416 --> 00:41:35.782
Can you go a bit higher?

00:41:35.784 --> 00:41:38.050
If I go any higher,
only dogs will hear me.

00:41:38.052 --> 00:41:39.151
Try.

00:41:39.153 --> 00:41:40.619
Freddie's note. Sorry.

00:41:40.621 --> 00:41:42.387
<i>Go on, roll the tape.</i>

00:41:42.389 --> 00:41:45.059
Overdub 24 of "Fred's Thing."

00:41:53.534 --> 00:41:54.666
How was that?

00:41:54.668 --> 00:41:56.168
- <i>Better?</i>
- Higher.

00:41:56.170 --> 00:41:58.838
Jesus! How many more
"Galileos" do you want?

00:41:58.840 --> 00:42:00.505
Freddie wants to do
a few more overdubs.

00:42:00.507 --> 00:42:01.740
Do we even have
any tape left?

00:42:01.742 --> 00:42:03.610
I do have to say
the tape is wearing out.

00:42:03.612 --> 00:42:04.845
<i>It can't take much more.</i>

00:42:04.847 --> 00:42:06.545
Yeah, we can't afford
much more.

00:42:06.547 --> 00:42:08.481
We're already
three weeks over schedule.

00:42:08.483 --> 00:42:12.221
Dub 26 of "Fred's Thing."

00:42:13.355 --> 00:42:14.356
One more, one more.

00:42:15.489 --> 00:42:16.858
One more.

00:42:18.293 --> 00:42:19.992
Again.

00:42:19.994 --> 00:42:21.196
Go on, roll the track.

00:42:22.864 --> 00:42:24.165
Who even is Galileo?

00:42:27.802 --> 00:42:29.769
<i>My nuts feel like
they're in my chest right now.</i>

00:42:29.771 --> 00:42:31.170
- Are we done?
- <i>That's it.</i>

00:42:31.172 --> 00:42:32.237
<i>He loves you.</i>

00:42:37.077 --> 00:42:38.146
That's it.

00:42:41.416 --> 00:42:43.118
It's beautiful! Love it!

00:43:27.461 --> 00:43:29.465
Christ.

00:43:33.768 --> 00:43:34.967
Well...

00:43:34.969 --> 00:43:36.970
I'm not entirely sure...

00:43:36.972 --> 00:43:38.970
that's the album
you promised us.

00:43:38.972 --> 00:43:41.407
No, it's better than the album
we promised you.

00:43:41.409 --> 00:43:42.307
It's better than any album

00:43:42.309 --> 00:43:44.411
anyone's ever promised you,
darling.

00:43:44.413 --> 00:43:45.512
It's a bloody masterpiece.

00:43:45.514 --> 00:43:47.512
- Christ.
- It is a good album, Ray.

00:43:47.514 --> 00:43:48.847
We prefer "masterpiece."

00:43:48.849 --> 00:43:50.418
It's expensive,
and as for...

00:43:51.152 --> 00:43:52.452
<i>"Bohemian..."</i>

00:43:52.454 --> 00:43:53.653
<i>Rhapsody.</i>

00:43:53.655 --> 00:43:55.253
Rhapsody.
What is that?

00:43:55.255 --> 00:43:57.456
- It's an epic poem.
- It goes on forever.

00:43:57.458 --> 00:43:58.891
Six bloody minutes.

00:43:58.893 --> 00:44:01.226
I pity your wife if you think
six minutes is forever.

00:44:02.896 --> 00:44:04.162
And do you know what?

00:44:04.164 --> 00:44:05.632
We're going to release it
as our single.

00:44:05.634 --> 00:44:08.168
Not possible.
Anything over three minutes...

00:44:08.170 --> 00:44:11.737
and the radio stations
won't program it, period.

00:44:11.739 --> 00:44:14.773
And what on earth
is it about, anyway?

00:44:14.775 --> 00:44:16.309
Scaramouche?

00:44:16.311 --> 00:44:17.177
Galileo?

00:44:17.179 --> 00:44:19.244
And all that
"Ismillah" business!

00:44:19.246 --> 00:44:21.349
"Ishmillah"?

00:44:22.751 --> 00:44:24.516
Bismillah.

00:44:24.518 --> 00:44:25.751
Oh, aye.

00:44:25.753 --> 00:44:26.885
Bismillah.

00:44:26.887 --> 00:44:29.891
What's it about, anyway?
Bloody Bismillah?

00:44:31.760 --> 00:44:33.525
True poetry
is for the listener.

00:44:33.527 --> 00:44:35.929
It ruins the mystery
if everything's explained.

00:44:35.931 --> 00:44:37.429
Seldom ruins sales.

00:44:37.431 --> 00:44:39.532
Three minutes
is the standard.

00:44:39.534 --> 00:44:40.867
John.

00:44:40.869 --> 00:44:42.135
Yeah, we need radio.

00:44:42.137 --> 00:44:44.836
Format is three minutes,
I have to agree with Ray.

00:44:44.838 --> 00:44:47.139
I actually think
the single's <i>Love of My Life.</i>

00:44:47.141 --> 00:44:48.007
No.

00:44:48.009 --> 00:44:49.108
Okay, how about John's song...

00:44:49.110 --> 00:44:51.778
<i>You're My Best Friend?</i>
You know?

00:44:51.780 --> 00:44:53.445
"Ooh, you make me live."

00:44:53.447 --> 00:44:55.016
Catchy, stronger.

00:44:56.717 --> 00:44:59.017
What about
<i>I'm in Love with My Car?</i>

00:44:59.019 --> 00:45:00.820
You're joking!
Oh, Jesus.

00:45:00.822 --> 00:45:02.655
I love it.

00:45:02.657 --> 00:45:04.057
Well,
that's the kind of song...

00:45:04.059 --> 00:45:06.592
teenagers can crank up
the volume in their car...

00:45:06.594 --> 00:45:08.293
and bang their heads to.

00:45:08.295 --> 00:45:12.063
<i>Bohemian Rhapsody</i>
will never be that song.

00:45:12.065 --> 00:45:14.766
It's a band decision,
<i>Bohemian Rhapsody.</i>

00:45:14.768 --> 00:45:16.534
- That's it.
- <i>You're My Best Friend...</i>

00:45:16.536 --> 00:45:17.702
and it's my money.

00:45:17.704 --> 00:45:19.273
<i>Bo-Rap,</i> period.

00:45:21.376 --> 00:45:22.377
Or we walk.

00:45:24.713 --> 00:45:26.515
<i>MacArthur Park</i>
was seven minutes long.

00:45:27.648 --> 00:45:28.880
It was a hit.

00:45:28.882 --> 00:45:31.684
Look, I'm not arguing
<i>Bohemian</i> whatever's...

00:45:31.686 --> 00:45:32.985
- musicianship.
- <i>...Rhapsody.</i>

00:45:32.987 --> 00:45:34.920
But there's no way in hell
the station will play...

00:45:34.922 --> 00:45:37.190
a 6-minute
quasi-operatic dirge...

00:45:37.192 --> 00:45:39.492
comprised of nonsense words!

00:45:39.494 --> 00:45:41.161
Bismillah? Bullshit!

00:45:41.163 --> 00:45:44.463
I paid for this record,
so I say what goes!

00:45:44.465 --> 00:45:46.532
Have we no legal
recourse on this?

00:45:46.534 --> 00:45:47.534
Ray...

00:45:47.536 --> 00:45:49.338
you did <i>Dark Side of the Moon,</i>
didn't you?

00:45:51.172 --> 00:45:52.037
I did.

00:45:52.039 --> 00:45:54.509
Yeah, I absolutely
love that record.

00:45:55.643 --> 00:45:57.811
Legally, no.

00:45:57.813 --> 00:46:00.945
No, he's got all your balls
in a vice.

00:46:00.947 --> 00:46:02.048
It's a different matter
in the court

00:46:02.050 --> 00:46:04.316
of public opinion,
of course.

00:46:04.318 --> 00:46:07.922
Ray Foster's a giant name
in the music industry, but...

00:46:09.023 --> 00:46:10.893
to the average person...

00:46:11.893 --> 00:46:14.128
Say the name Queen,
on the other hand...

00:46:16.498 --> 00:46:18.500
ears prick up.

00:46:28.744 --> 00:46:31.844
We're going with
<i>You're My Best Friend.</i>

00:46:31.846 --> 00:46:32.912
- Done.
- No.

00:46:32.914 --> 00:46:36.014
We know what we have,
even if you don't.

00:46:36.016 --> 00:46:39.186
It's called <i>Bohemian Rhapsody.</i>

00:46:40.588 --> 00:46:44.593
You will forever be known
as the man who lost Queen.

00:46:56.771 --> 00:46:58.304
Temperamental artists, eh?

00:46:58.306 --> 00:47:00.171
They're well aware
they're tied to a contract...

00:47:00.173 --> 00:47:01.507
but who knows
what goes on...

00:47:01.509 --> 00:47:03.809
inside the inscrutable mind
of the recording artist?

00:47:03.811 --> 00:47:04.878
Mark these words.

00:47:04.880 --> 00:47:06.612
If they're not careful...

00:47:06.614 --> 00:47:07.780
by the end of the year...

00:47:07.782 --> 00:47:10.518
no one will know
the name Queen.

00:47:11.686 --> 00:47:13.255
Christ!

00:47:17.925 --> 00:47:20.293
You can take that
out of our royalties!

00:47:20.295 --> 00:47:21.894
- Twat!
- Wanker!

00:47:21.896 --> 00:47:23.595
You can shove
your gold disks!

00:47:23.597 --> 00:47:24.896
You made a mistake, Foster!

00:47:24.898 --> 00:47:25.965
Arsehole!

00:47:25.967 --> 00:47:27.465
You'll never have
a gold disk...

00:47:27.467 --> 00:47:28.703
you medium talent!

00:47:29.903 --> 00:47:32.070
And to think
I worked with Hendrix.

00:47:32.072 --> 00:47:34.541
<i>In the studio today...</i>

00:47:34.543 --> 00:47:38.545
<i>...singer Frederick Mercury!</i>

00:47:38.547 --> 00:47:39.979
<i>So what have you
got today for us?</i>

00:47:39.981 --> 00:47:42.081
Have you got a little taste
of the new record?

00:47:42.083 --> 00:47:43.983
I'm really not supposed to.

00:47:43.985 --> 00:47:46.555
Oh, forbidden fruit?
Don't tempt me!

00:47:47.822 --> 00:47:50.192
- <i>"I'm in Love with My Car!"</i>
- Other side.

00:47:52.059 --> 00:47:54.159
<i>"Bohemian Rhapsody."</i>

00:47:54.161 --> 00:47:55.829
I didn't know Freddie
knew Kenny so well.

00:47:55.831 --> 00:47:57.063
<i>The BBC won't play it.</i>

00:47:57.065 --> 00:47:58.197
Nor did I.

00:47:58.199 --> 00:48:00.231
In fact, no one will play it
on the radio...

00:48:00.233 --> 00:48:02.066
so EMI won't release it.

00:48:02.068 --> 00:48:03.869
<i>What's wrong
with this song?</i>

00:48:03.871 --> 00:48:06.072
Nothing's wrong
with it at all.

00:48:06.074 --> 00:48:08.840
Except that
it's six minutes long.

00:48:08.842 --> 00:48:09.941
Six minutes?

00:48:09.943 --> 00:48:12.043
You'd have to be mad
to play it.

00:48:12.045 --> 00:48:13.211
Oh, you'd have to be bonkers.

00:48:13.213 --> 00:48:16.050
- I positively forbid it.
- Let's hear it.

00:48:16.818 --> 00:48:18.885
Ladies and ladies...

00:48:18.887 --> 00:48:21.320
a Capital Radio exclusive...

00:52:24.764 --> 00:52:27.868
it was the largest paying

I was saying.

00:53:25.860 --> 00:53:27.829
Because it's true.

00:53:36.003 --> 00:53:38.503
Freddie, what's wrong?

00:53:38.505 --> 00:53:40.708
<i>♪ Love of my life,
don't leave me</i>

00:53:41.342 --> 00:53:43.878
<i>♪ You've stolen my love</i>

00:53:44.577 --> 00:53:47.815
<i>♪ And now desert me ♪</i>

00:53:48.882 --> 00:53:52.386
Something's been wrong
for a while now.

00:54:00.860 --> 00:54:02.663
Say it.

00:54:06.099 --> 00:54:08.036
Say it.

00:54:14.307 --> 00:54:17.545
I've been thinking
about it a lot.

00:54:23.251 --> 00:54:24.719
I think I'm bisexual.

00:54:28.489 --> 00:54:29.791
Freddie, you're gay.

00:54:48.041 --> 00:54:49.175
I've known for a while now.

00:54:49.177 --> 00:54:50.577
I just didn't want to
admit it.

00:54:54.047 --> 00:54:56.683
It's funny, really. This is
what I always settle for.

00:54:58.253 --> 00:54:59.650
"I love you, but..."

00:54:59.652 --> 00:55:02.820
"I love you, Mary,
but I need space."

00:55:02.822 --> 00:55:06.791
"I love you, Mary,
but I've met someone else."

00:55:06.793 --> 00:55:09.763
And now,
"I love you, but I'm..."

00:55:15.635 --> 00:55:17.235
And this is the hardest,

00:55:17.237 --> 00:55:20.007
because it's not
even your fault.

00:55:34.054 --> 00:55:36.190
No, don't take it off.

00:55:37.023 --> 00:55:37.889
Don't take it off.

00:55:37.891 --> 00:55:39.827
You promised me
you'd never take it off.

00:55:43.063 --> 00:55:45.166
What do you want from me?

00:55:51.405 --> 00:55:52.941
Almost everything.

00:55:56.443 --> 00:55:58.880
I want you in my life.

00:56:00.713 --> 00:56:01.715
Why?

00:56:05.152 --> 00:56:07.889
We believe in each other.

00:56:09.389 --> 00:56:11.225
And that's everything.

00:56:13.527 --> 00:56:14.963
For us.

00:56:25.539 --> 00:56:29.611
Your life is going to be
very difficult.

00:57:02.208 --> 00:57:04.077
What do you think?

00:57:06.179 --> 00:57:07.311
Gay-er?

00:57:07.313 --> 00:57:09.949
Not this, darling, the house.

00:57:09.951 --> 00:57:11.782
Isn't it amazing?

00:57:11.784 --> 00:57:13.686
Mary's already
moved in next door,

00:57:13.688 --> 00:57:15.621
so she can visit
the cats and me.

00:57:15.623 --> 00:57:16.688
Uh-huh.

00:57:16.690 --> 00:57:18.557
Each cat will have
his own room.

00:57:18.559 --> 00:57:20.492
Delilah's by the kitchen...

00:57:20.494 --> 00:57:21.959
Miko's next door.

00:57:21.961 --> 00:57:24.229
Tiffany, Oscar, Romeo,
all upstairs.

00:57:24.231 --> 00:57:28.766
Lilly's room is even larger
than this one! Spoilt thing.

00:57:28.768 --> 00:57:29.834
Well, I'm not sure

00:57:29.836 --> 00:57:31.670
the echo is quite
pronounced enough.

00:57:31.672 --> 00:57:33.938
Eh-oh!

00:57:35.943 --> 00:57:38.278
Oh, I knew
you'd appreciate it.

00:57:39.447 --> 00:57:41.046
Stay for dinner.

00:57:41.048 --> 00:57:42.514
Anything you fancy.

00:57:42.516 --> 00:57:45.820
I can't.
Wife, kids, you know.

00:57:47.121 --> 00:57:48.590
Of course.

00:57:50.458 --> 00:57:52.391
Well, come on.
We'll eat off the floor.

00:57:52.393 --> 00:57:54.159
It's clean enough.

00:57:54.161 --> 00:57:55.762
Another time, Fred.

00:58:12.713 --> 00:58:14.612
- <i>Hello?</i>
- Mary.

00:58:14.614 --> 00:58:16.914
- Hi.
- <i>Hello, my love.</i>

00:58:16.916 --> 00:58:18.016
<i>Hi.</i>

00:58:18.018 --> 00:58:20.686
I need you to do
something for me.

00:58:20.688 --> 00:58:22.787
But you can't
ask any questions.

00:58:22.789 --> 00:58:24.188
Freddie, what are you
doing this time?

00:58:24.190 --> 00:58:27.661
No, I just told you...
you can't ask any questions.

00:58:28.628 --> 00:58:30.862
<i>Right.</i>

00:58:30.864 --> 00:58:33.734
I want you to go
to your bedroom window.

00:58:34.702 --> 00:58:36.337
<i>Look out of it.</i>

00:58:45.612 --> 00:58:48.646
- Do you see me?
- <i>Yes, I do see you.</i>

00:58:48.648 --> 00:58:50.751
Now, you do the same.

00:58:53.554 --> 00:58:54.756
Oh...

00:59:02.496 --> 00:59:04.097
Keep yours on.

00:59:06.199 --> 00:59:07.666
Come have a drink.

00:59:07.668 --> 00:59:09.237
- <i>Now?</i>
- Right now.

00:59:10.204 --> 00:59:11.239
It's late, Freddie.

00:59:12.239 --> 00:59:13.671
Come on.

00:59:13.673 --> 00:59:14.840
<i>Please.</i>

00:59:14.842 --> 00:59:16.978
<i>Do you have something
to drink?</i>

00:59:17.577 --> 00:59:18.811
I suppose.

00:59:18.813 --> 00:59:20.845
<i>Go get it.
Pour yourself something.</i>

00:59:20.847 --> 00:59:22.916
<i>Pour yourself a drink,
darling.</i>

00:59:24.784 --> 00:59:25.987
Do you have it?

00:59:29.255 --> 00:59:30.857
Yes.

00:59:31.492 --> 00:59:33.061
Cheers.

00:59:33.561 --> 00:59:35.063
<i>Cheers.</i>

00:59:36.063 --> 00:59:37.831
To you, my love.

00:59:38.833 --> 00:59:40.735
To you, Freddie.

00:59:42.668 --> 00:59:43.904
Good night.

00:59:44.438 --> 00:59:45.940
Good night.

00:59:57.684 --> 00:59:58.851
- <i>Hello?</i>
- Paul.

00:59:58.853 --> 00:59:59.918
<i>Freddie?</i>

00:59:59.920 --> 01:00:01.286
Sweetheart,
I want to throw a party.

01:00:01.288 --> 01:00:03.554
<i>Okay.
Who do you want to invite?</i>

01:00:03.556 --> 01:00:04.688
People.

01:00:04.690 --> 01:00:06.391
I want you to shake
the freak tree

01:00:06.393 --> 01:00:08.693
and invite anyone
who plops to the ground.

01:00:08.695 --> 01:00:11.862
Dwarfs and giants...

01:00:11.864 --> 01:00:16.367
magicians, Zulu tribesmen,
contortionists...

01:00:16.369 --> 01:00:18.670
fire eaters...

01:00:18.672 --> 01:00:21.005
and priests.

01:00:21.007 --> 01:00:23.108
We're going to
need to confess.

01:00:32.952 --> 01:00:34.653
Fill me up, will you, Trixie?

01:00:34.655 --> 01:00:36.854
Marvelous, Fred!
You've outdone yourself!

01:00:36.856 --> 01:00:39.291
Thank you, John.
I'm so glad you love it!

01:00:39.293 --> 01:00:42.293
Mmm. They say money can't
buy happiness, darlings!

01:00:42.295 --> 01:00:45.331
But it does allow you
to give it away!

01:00:45.333 --> 01:00:47.532
I see you and Paul
are getting along quite well.

01:00:47.534 --> 01:00:48.833
He's Trixie now...

01:00:48.835 --> 01:00:50.369
'cause he's always
up to something.

01:00:50.371 --> 01:00:52.237
So, tell me, Rog...

01:00:52.239 --> 01:00:55.041
what's the sexiest part
of a car?

01:01:02.483 --> 01:01:03.782
Ah!

01:01:03.784 --> 01:01:05.450
Well, well, well!

01:01:05.452 --> 01:01:06.651
Ah, your majesty!

01:01:06.653 --> 01:01:08.554
No, I'm not her majesty!

01:01:08.556 --> 01:01:10.822
We're her majesty, darlings!

01:01:13.360 --> 01:01:14.992
- Cheers!
- Cheers!

01:01:14.994 --> 01:01:16.295
- Cheers!
- Cheers!

01:01:16.297 --> 01:01:18.130
- Thank you, my loves!
- Rog.

01:01:18.132 --> 01:01:19.430
Where's Mary?

01:01:19.432 --> 01:01:23.971
It's not exactly
her scene, is it, Freddie?

01:01:24.704 --> 01:01:25.907
Hmm.

01:01:27.041 --> 01:01:28.706
Fabulous, isn't it?

01:01:28.708 --> 01:01:30.010
If you say so.

01:01:33.646 --> 01:01:34.849
Hmm.

01:01:35.983 --> 01:01:38.016
You're starting to look
like each other.

01:01:38.018 --> 01:01:39.284
What's wrong with that,
Brian?

01:01:39.286 --> 01:01:41.019
You're supposed to be
in a rock band, Freddie.

01:01:41.021 --> 01:01:42.287
Not the Village People.

01:01:43.489 --> 01:01:45.691
You might want to think about
cutting your hair one day.

01:01:45.693 --> 01:01:47.559
Never.
I was born like this.

01:01:49.063 --> 01:01:51.265
Come on!

01:01:52.398 --> 01:01:53.898
- Let's dance!
- Yes!

01:01:53.900 --> 01:01:55.733
I don't dance, Freddie.

01:01:55.735 --> 01:01:57.436
I need a few more
of these for that.

01:01:57.438 --> 01:01:59.905
It's my party,
and I demand you dance!

01:01:59.907 --> 01:02:01.072
We should go.

01:02:01.074 --> 01:02:02.608
By royal decree!

01:02:02.610 --> 01:02:03.878
We're gonna go, actually.

01:02:04.445 --> 01:02:05.510
Oh, God! You're dull.

01:02:05.512 --> 01:02:08.112
If you were any more dull,
you'd be Deacy.

01:02:08.114 --> 01:02:09.713
What are you
complaining about?

01:02:09.715 --> 01:02:10.984
You've got your little pet.

01:02:13.286 --> 01:02:14.619
I have...

01:02:14.621 --> 01:02:16.688
and he's loyal.

01:02:16.690 --> 01:02:19.858
Loyalty's so important.
Don't you think, Dominique?

01:02:19.860 --> 01:02:21.293
Careful, Fred.

01:02:22.829 --> 01:02:24.795
- Let's go.
- Where you going?

01:02:24.797 --> 01:02:25.930
Home.

01:02:25.932 --> 01:02:27.264
Just a joke.

01:02:27.266 --> 01:02:31.202
Freddie, sometimes
you're a total prick.

01:02:31.204 --> 01:02:33.373
- Good night.
- Brian.

01:02:37.545 --> 01:02:38.677
Forget them.

01:02:38.679 --> 01:02:40.746
Come on!
Your guests are waiting.

01:02:40.748 --> 01:02:42.916
They all want a little
Mercury in their cup.

01:02:43.282 --> 01:02:44.284
Come on.

01:02:45.186 --> 01:02:46.418
All right!

01:02:47.655 --> 01:02:49.220
My darlings...

01:02:49.222 --> 01:02:51.057
the time has finally come...

01:02:51.692 --> 01:02:53.858
to get absolutely...

01:02:53.860 --> 01:02:55.563
shit-faced!

01:03:00.701 --> 01:03:04.403
Whoo!

01:03:04.405 --> 01:03:07.208
<i>Senor,</i> where's
my marching powder?

01:03:31.197 --> 01:03:32.798
You've got a set of balls.

01:03:32.800 --> 01:03:35.833
Go fetch me
a drink and find out.

01:03:35.835 --> 01:03:37.135
I may work
for you tonight...

01:03:37.137 --> 01:03:39.670
but put your hands on me
again, and I'll thump you.

01:03:39.672 --> 01:03:41.005
Got it?

01:03:41.007 --> 01:03:42.874
I'm terribly sorry.

01:03:42.876 --> 01:03:45.376
I didn't mean to offend you.
I'm sorry.

01:03:45.378 --> 01:03:47.778
I won't do that again,
all right?

01:03:50.884 --> 01:03:52.954
Let me get you a beer.

01:03:55.521 --> 01:03:56.523
I wouldn't mind a beer.

01:03:58.625 --> 01:04:01.528
Can you just tell me where
we keep them?

01:04:02.896 --> 01:04:05.229
You're very handsome.

01:04:05.231 --> 01:04:07.634
I love a man in uniform.

01:04:09.603 --> 01:04:11.438
So do I.

01:04:14.541 --> 01:04:16.874
<i>So, all your friends
have left you alone.</i>

01:04:16.876 --> 01:04:18.476
They're not my friends.

01:04:18.478 --> 01:04:19.480
Not really.

01:04:20.447 --> 01:04:22.447
Just distraction.

01:04:22.449 --> 01:04:23.782
From what?

01:04:23.784 --> 01:04:26.354
The in-between moments,
I suppose.

01:04:27.954 --> 01:04:30.555
I find them intolerable.

01:04:30.557 --> 01:04:32.190
All of the...

01:04:32.192 --> 01:04:36.998
darkness you thought you left
behind comes creeping back in.

01:04:38.798 --> 01:04:40.201
I know what you mean.

01:04:41.835 --> 01:04:43.170
Really?

01:04:45.237 --> 01:04:46.740
What is it that
you do with them?

01:04:48.409 --> 01:04:50.778
Spend them
with real friends.

01:04:51.911 --> 01:04:54.547
You look like
you could use a friend.

01:05:14.934 --> 01:05:16.469
I like you.

01:05:17.905 --> 01:05:19.306
I like you, too, Freddie.

01:05:22.641 --> 01:05:26.379
Come and find me when
you decide you like yourself.

01:05:32.753 --> 01:05:34.588
Can I have
your name at least?

01:05:36.190 --> 01:05:38.523
It's Jim Hutton.

01:05:38.525 --> 01:05:40.758
- Good night, Jim.
- Good night, Freddie.

01:05:40.760 --> 01:05:42.530
Or should I say good morning?

01:05:46.367 --> 01:05:48.066
I want a new boat.

01:05:48.068 --> 01:05:49.467
This one is for me.
This one.

01:05:49.469 --> 01:05:50.802
Didn't you say
we were going to see him?

01:05:50.804 --> 01:05:52.436
- I've got an hour left.
- Wait. What about this one?

01:05:52.438 --> 01:05:53.704
No, I think
we'll still make that.

01:05:53.706 --> 01:05:54.773
It's a good size.

01:05:54.775 --> 01:05:56.277
Screw him.

01:05:57.744 --> 01:05:59.413
Everyone up
on the drum risers!

01:06:00.313 --> 01:06:02.380
- Up on the drum risers.
- Come on!

01:06:02.382 --> 01:06:04.016
Thank you, Chrissie.
Showing some enthusiasm.

01:06:04.018 --> 01:06:05.450
- Wives and everyone, Brian?
- Me?

01:06:05.452 --> 01:06:06.516
Yes! Come on, John. Everyone.

01:06:06.518 --> 01:06:07.854
- I'm not waiting any longer.
- Let's go.

01:06:08.755 --> 01:06:09.820
Get up.

01:06:09.822 --> 01:06:11.021
- Bass?
- No, you don't need it.

01:06:11.023 --> 01:06:12.324
Get up.

01:06:12.326 --> 01:06:13.561
- Come on, Rog, take your time.
- All right.

01:06:14.527 --> 01:06:15.760
What's this about?

01:06:15.762 --> 01:06:16.728
You remember our last concert?

01:06:16.730 --> 01:06:19.498
The crowd were singing
our songs back to us.

01:06:19.500 --> 01:06:22.300
I mean, it was deafening,
but it was wonderful.

01:06:22.302 --> 01:06:24.168
They're becoming
a part of our show.

01:06:24.170 --> 01:06:26.271
I want to encourage that,
so...

01:06:26.273 --> 01:06:28.941
I've got an idea to involve
them a little bit more.

01:06:28.943 --> 01:06:30.208
Let's start with this.

01:06:32.579 --> 01:06:33.681
Stamp to this beat.

01:06:35.715 --> 01:06:36.717
Genius.

01:06:37.184 --> 01:06:38.586
Thank you, John.

01:06:39.652 --> 01:06:40.653
Come on.

01:06:41.521 --> 01:06:43.557
Good.

01:06:46.259 --> 01:06:48.862
Now, I want you to clap
on the third beat.

01:06:53.032 --> 01:06:54.566
Don't speed up.

01:06:54.568 --> 01:06:56.434
Rog, keep that time.

01:06:56.436 --> 01:06:59.104
No Prenter?

01:06:59.106 --> 01:07:01.005
It's unusual to see you
without your clone.

01:07:01.007 --> 01:07:02.840
It's unusual seeing you
be so bitchy.

01:07:02.842 --> 01:07:04.474
It's usually me.

01:07:04.476 --> 01:07:06.779
Ah, you kept time, Rog.
Good.

01:07:09.250 --> 01:07:10.518
What's going on?

01:07:11.217 --> 01:07:12.918
You'd know
if you were on time.

01:07:12.920 --> 01:07:16.690
I'm a performer, darling,
not a Swiss train conductor.

01:07:19.793 --> 01:07:21.525
Sorry I'm late.

01:07:21.527 --> 01:07:22.529
Again.

01:07:23.028 --> 01:07:24.095
All right.

01:07:24.097 --> 01:07:25.463
Now, will you
please tell me

01:07:25.465 --> 01:07:27.065
why you're not playing
any instruments?

01:07:27.067 --> 01:07:31.068
I wanna give the audience
a song that they can perform.

01:07:31.070 --> 01:07:32.903
All right?
Let them be part of the band.

01:07:32.905 --> 01:07:34.039
So, what can they do?

01:07:43.083 --> 01:07:44.449
Imagine...

01:07:44.451 --> 01:07:46.284
thousands of people...

01:07:46.286 --> 01:07:47.887
doing this in unison.

01:07:48.521 --> 01:07:49.586
Huh?

01:07:49.588 --> 01:07:50.757
Well?

01:07:51.324 --> 01:07:52.592
What's the lyric?

01:08:04.170 --> 01:08:06.304
<i>♪ Buddy, you're a boy
Make a big noise</i>

01:08:06.306 --> 01:08:09.273

01:08:27.627 --> 01:08:30.227

<i>♪ You got blood on your face</i>

<i>♪ You big disgrace</i>

<i>♪ Wavin' your banner

01:08:44.011 --> 01:08:45.610

- <i>♪ We will, we will rock you</i>
- <i>♪ We will, we will rock you</i>

01:08:49.015 --> 01:08:50.017
<i>Yeah!</i>

01:08:51.150 --> 01:08:53.550
<i>♪ Buddy, you're an old man,
poor man</i>

01:08:53.552 --> 01:08:54.686
<i>♪ Pleading with your eyes</i>

01:08:54.688 --> 01:08:56.388

<i>♪ Somebody better put you

01:09:02.095 --> 01:09:03.428
<i>Do it!</i>

01:09:03.430 --> 01:09:06.734
- <i>♪ We will, we will rock you</i>
- <i>♪ Rock you</i>

01:09:08.467 --> 01:09:12.305
- <i>♪ We will, we will rock you</i>
- <i>♪ Rock you</i>

01:09:13.939 --> 01:09:15.173
<i>Yeah!</i>

01:09:44.470 --> 01:09:47.304
<i>All right! I feel like taking
a bite out of the Big Apple!</i>

01:09:49.309 --> 01:09:51.209
<i>Who wants to take a bite
out of me?</i>

01:09:52.345 --> 01:09:54.481
<i>All right, play with me now.</i>

01:09:56.015 --> 01:09:57.848
Eh-oh!

01:09:57.850 --> 01:10:01.052
- Eh-oh!
- Eh-oh!

01:10:02.956 --> 01:10:05.857
Never seen anyone interact
with a crowd like that.

01:10:05.859 --> 01:10:08.062
Bigger than any band,
don't you think?

01:10:10.363 --> 01:10:12.028
I mean, Queen...

01:10:12.030 --> 01:10:14.465
how long can that last?

01:10:14.467 --> 01:10:16.101
Did he say
something to you?

01:10:16.103 --> 01:10:17.869
Not explicitly.

01:10:17.871 --> 01:10:20.472
But we've had some interest
from CBS Records...

01:10:20.474 --> 01:10:22.109
about a solo deal.

01:10:32.685 --> 01:10:34.085
Well, that's a big number.

01:10:34.087 --> 01:10:36.187
That's a Freddie-size number.

01:10:36.189 --> 01:10:38.391
You should be the one
to propose it.

01:10:39.091 --> 01:10:40.525
Hi, guys. How's it going?

01:10:40.527 --> 01:10:42.126
- Good.
- Everything's great.

01:10:42.128 --> 01:10:43.794
John, another drink?

01:10:43.796 --> 01:10:44.861
Er, no, I'm fine.

01:10:44.863 --> 01:10:46.429
Here's the Coke.
Coming right up.

01:10:46.431 --> 01:10:48.635
- Freddie.
- Oh, there you are.

01:10:50.703 --> 01:10:52.573
Oh, God! Freddie!
Put me down!

01:10:53.940 --> 01:10:54.972
You were brilliant.

01:10:54.974 --> 01:10:57.174
Ah, that's only because
I knew you were watching.

01:10:57.176 --> 01:10:58.308
I've missed you.

01:10:58.310 --> 01:10:59.880
We have
so much to catch up on.

01:11:01.047 --> 01:11:02.679
Oh, thank you.

01:11:02.681 --> 01:11:04.818
This is my boyfriend, David.

01:11:05.417 --> 01:11:06.953
David, this is Freddie.

01:11:08.488 --> 01:11:09.923
Magnificent show.

01:11:10.923 --> 01:11:12.357
Thank you.

01:11:12.359 --> 01:11:14.962
It's so kind of you,
I appreciate it.

01:11:15.996 --> 01:11:17.096
Thank you so much.

01:11:21.533 --> 01:11:22.735
Where's your ring?

01:11:24.069 --> 01:11:26.840
I just didn't want to travel
with something so valuable.

01:11:29.509 --> 01:11:32.143
Freddie, there are some people
here for you to see.

01:11:32.145 --> 01:11:33.447
You promised you'd say hello.

01:11:35.716 --> 01:11:37.151
- Oh, did I?
- Mmm-hmm.

01:11:39.552 --> 01:11:40.985
We should go.

01:11:40.987 --> 01:11:41.989
Will I see you soon?

01:11:43.323 --> 01:11:46.527
Yes, of course.
Of course.

01:11:47.761 --> 01:11:49.259
Mwah!

01:11:49.261 --> 01:11:50.961
It's a pleasure to meet you,
David.

01:11:50.963 --> 01:11:52.196
And you.

01:11:52.198 --> 01:11:53.466
And well done again.

01:11:54.367 --> 01:11:55.969
And you.

01:11:56.269 --> 01:11:57.471
Bye.

01:11:58.905 --> 01:12:01.371
Thank you for coming
such a long way.

01:12:01.373 --> 01:12:02.608
Bye.

01:12:15.755 --> 01:12:17.854
Then you've got
the MTV interview...

01:12:17.856 --> 01:12:21.959
and the plane to Houston
for the special.

01:12:21.961 --> 01:12:23.730
Back here on Friday.

01:12:24.863 --> 01:12:27.134
Listen to me now.

01:12:27.934 --> 01:12:29.866
Do you know who sold

01:12:29.868 --> 01:12:31.971
4% of all the records
purchased last year?

01:12:32.506 --> 01:12:33.941
Worldwide?

01:12:34.942 --> 01:12:36.607
Michael Jackson.

01:12:36.609 --> 01:12:38.876
Not the Jackson 5.

01:12:38.878 --> 01:12:40.044
Michael Jackson.

01:12:40.046 --> 01:12:43.516
And I think
you could do even better.

01:12:44.484 --> 01:12:47.718
In fact, I've had an offer
from CBS Records.

01:12:47.720 --> 01:12:48.986
It's a lot of money
for you, Fred,

01:12:48.988 --> 01:12:51.859
and I think
you should consider it.

01:12:55.494 --> 01:12:59.030
Are you asking me
to break up the band?

01:12:59.032 --> 01:13:03.735
I'm just pointing out what
awaits you if you go solo.

01:13:03.737 --> 01:13:06.172
An end to your
frustrations.

01:13:08.007 --> 01:13:09.742
My frustrations?

01:13:11.176 --> 01:13:12.179
Paul?

01:13:15.113 --> 01:13:17.917
I don't know what
you're talking about, John.

01:13:22.287 --> 01:13:23.687
Perhaps I misunderstood.

01:13:23.689 --> 01:13:25.389
<i>Yes, sir.</i>

01:13:25.391 --> 01:13:26.523
Pull over.

01:13:26.525 --> 01:13:27.894
Stop the car, pull over.

01:13:30.329 --> 01:13:31.963
- Get out. Out now!
- What the hell?

01:13:31.965 --> 01:13:33.365
Get out of this car.
You're fired.

01:13:33.367 --> 01:13:34.432
What're you talking about,
fired?

01:13:34.434 --> 01:13:35.566
I said get out.

01:13:35.568 --> 01:13:37.302
- Freddie, you are high!
- I said get out!

01:13:37.304 --> 01:13:38.501
What are you
talking about?

01:13:38.503 --> 01:13:40.573
Out! Out or I'll kill you!

01:13:42.408 --> 01:13:44.808
Get out,
you treacherous piss flap.

01:13:44.810 --> 01:13:45.875
You're not
thinking clearly.

01:13:45.877 --> 01:13:47.144
Get your ass
out of my car now.

01:13:47.146 --> 01:13:48.148
Get out!

01:13:48.948 --> 01:13:49.880
Out!

01:13:49.882 --> 01:13:52.583
Get your ass out of my car!
Get out!

01:13:52.585 --> 01:13:55.052
You're firing the
wrong snake, Freddie.

01:13:55.054 --> 01:13:56.521
You'll regret it.

01:13:56.523 --> 01:13:57.787
Get your ass out of here!

01:13:59.893 --> 01:14:00.894
Drive!

01:14:01.895 --> 01:14:04.062
Hey! What the hell? Move!

01:14:04.064 --> 01:14:06.731
Hey, watch it!
I'll run your ass over!

01:14:06.733 --> 01:14:08.869
Move!

01:14:22.815 --> 01:14:25.217
Did you know
anything about this?

01:14:26.618 --> 01:14:28.322
I warned him against it.

01:14:29.088 --> 01:14:30.420
Pure greed.

01:14:30.422 --> 01:14:32.322
Tried to break up
my family.

01:14:32.324 --> 01:14:34.157
We can manage the band.

01:14:34.159 --> 01:14:35.595
We don't need him.

01:14:36.628 --> 01:14:38.765
What do you know
about what I need?

01:14:40.132 --> 01:14:41.699
I know what it's like...

01:14:41.701 --> 01:14:43.500
not to belong.

01:14:43.502 --> 01:14:46.905
A queer Catholic boy
from Belfast.

01:14:46.907 --> 01:14:48.705
You know...

01:14:48.707 --> 01:14:52.712
I think my father
would rather see me dead...

01:14:53.645 --> 01:14:55.681
than let me be who I am.

01:15:00.153 --> 01:15:02.623
I'm gonna take care
of you now, Freddie.

01:15:04.222 --> 01:15:05.792
If you'll let me.

01:15:17.170 --> 01:15:19.070
What are you reading?

01:15:19.072 --> 01:15:20.707
Just the cricket.

01:15:25.979 --> 01:15:28.111
We're a rock and roll band.

01:15:28.113 --> 01:15:29.446
We don't do disco.

01:15:29.448 --> 01:15:31.749
- It's not disco.
- Then what is it?

01:15:31.751 --> 01:15:32.849
It's Queen.

01:15:32.851 --> 01:15:34.485
<i>So sorry, my darlings!</i>

01:15:34.487 --> 01:15:35.820
<i>Lost all track!</i>

01:15:35.822 --> 01:15:37.789
You fired Reid
without consulting us!

01:15:37.791 --> 01:15:39.924
You don't make decisions
for the band.

01:15:39.926 --> 01:15:40.927
Hey.

01:15:42.162 --> 01:15:45.129
Well, I'm terribly sorry,
dear.

01:15:45.131 --> 01:15:46.199
It's done.

01:15:47.466 --> 01:15:48.699
Besides...

01:15:48.701 --> 01:15:50.634
Miami will manage us.

01:15:50.636 --> 01:15:52.570
Won't you, darling?

01:15:52.572 --> 01:15:54.505
Erm... I'll think about it.

01:15:54.507 --> 01:15:56.406
- No.
- Are you high again?

01:15:56.408 --> 01:15:57.842
Well done, Columbo.

01:15:57.844 --> 01:15:59.076
You need to slow down, Fred.

01:15:59.078 --> 01:16:01.411
Oh, don't be such a bore.
I'm here, aren't I?

01:16:01.413 --> 01:16:02.479
Are you?

01:16:02.481 --> 01:16:03.684
I don't care
if you're shit-faced.

01:16:05.251 --> 01:16:06.253
As long as you can sing.

01:16:07.820 --> 01:16:10.187
No, John,
I don't wanna play it.

01:16:10.189 --> 01:16:11.321
Then I'm all for it.

01:16:11.323 --> 01:16:12.757
What's that supposed to mean?

01:16:12.759 --> 01:16:14.491
I'm tired of
the bloody anthems.

01:16:14.493 --> 01:16:16.295
I want the energy
in the clubs.

01:16:17.195 --> 01:16:18.263
The bodies,

01:16:18.265 --> 01:16:20.063
- I want to make people move.
- You mean disco?

01:16:20.065 --> 01:16:22.032
Why not?

01:16:22.034 --> 01:16:24.668
Do you mind pissing off?
This is a band discussion.

01:16:24.670 --> 01:16:26.704
Drum loops?
Synthesizers?

01:16:26.706 --> 01:16:28.606
- If you say so.
- It's not us!

01:16:28.608 --> 01:16:29.839
- Us?
- It's not Queen!

01:16:29.841 --> 01:16:31.476
Queen is whatever
I say it is!

01:16:32.712 --> 01:16:34.948
Well, you can play
your own bloody drums, then.

01:16:36.515 --> 01:16:37.815
Fred.

01:16:37.817 --> 01:16:39.784
Okay, let's see how good
a boxer you really are!

01:16:39.786 --> 01:16:41.686
Roger, take it easy!
Take it easy!

01:16:41.688 --> 01:16:43.353
Take it easy.

01:16:43.355 --> 01:16:44.356
All right, Muhammad Ali.

01:16:48.694 --> 01:16:49.896
That's...

01:16:51.832 --> 01:16:53.865
That's quite a cool riff,
actually.

01:16:53.867 --> 01:16:55.936
Hmm. You wrote that?

01:16:57.270 --> 01:16:58.405
That's really good.

01:16:59.505 --> 01:17:00.507
Yes, it will be...

01:17:01.873 --> 01:17:05.177
if you all can
just shut up and play.

01:17:06.011 --> 01:17:08.312
- He started it.
- Oh, shut up!

Freddie! Freddie,
as the leader of Queen...

01:19:07.966 --> 01:19:09.299
as the leader of Queen...

01:19:09.301 --> 01:19:11.369
do you feel responsible
for the success of the band?

01:19:11.371 --> 01:19:14.606
I'm not the leader of Queen,
I'm only the lead singer.

01:19:14.608 --> 01:19:16.639
Freddie!
A question for Freddie.

01:19:16.641 --> 01:19:17.974
Do you ever
doubt your talent?

01:19:17.976 --> 01:19:20.143
No, that's a stupid question.

01:19:20.145 --> 01:19:21.978
- Take it easy, Fred.
- What's next?

01:19:21.980 --> 01:19:24.048
Freddie, uh, your teeth!

01:19:24.050 --> 01:19:26.116
Why don't you
get your teeth fixed?

01:19:26.118 --> 01:19:28.619
I live in Britain.
I don't want to stand out.

01:19:28.621 --> 01:19:29.754
Next...

01:19:29.756 --> 01:19:31.522
Why don't you have
your manners fixed?

01:19:31.524 --> 01:19:33.757
That's an asshole question
to ask anybody.

01:19:33.759 --> 01:19:35.492
That's an asshole question.

01:19:35.494 --> 01:19:37.361
In your song <i>Life Is Real,</i>

01:19:37.363 --> 01:19:38.696
what do you mean
by the line...

01:19:38.698 --> 01:19:40.197
"Love is a roulette wheel"?

01:19:40.199 --> 01:19:42.132
Are you implying that
the more partners you have...

01:19:42.134 --> 01:19:44.668
the more chances
you have of...

01:19:44.670 --> 01:19:46.269
contracting something?

01:19:46.271 --> 01:19:47.274
What?

01:19:48.573 --> 01:19:51.008
I don't know, I haven't
figured out love yet.

01:19:51.010 --> 01:19:53.110
But it implies something else,
Freddie.

01:19:53.112 --> 01:19:55.713
That might be
a better question for Rog.

01:19:55.715 --> 01:19:57.415
Watch it.

01:19:57.417 --> 01:19:59.183
Freddie, concerning
your private life...

01:19:59.185 --> 01:20:00.918
there's lots of pictures
of you in the tabloids...

01:20:00.920 --> 01:20:02.251
looking drunk or ill.

01:20:02.253 --> 01:20:03.987
Which one is it, ill or drunk?

01:20:03.989 --> 01:20:06.691
I had a cold last week,
if anyone cares.

01:20:06.693 --> 01:20:09.360
As much as we'd love to answer
questions about colds...

01:20:09.362 --> 01:20:10.660
I'd like to speak
about the album.

01:20:10.662 --> 01:20:12.729
If anyone's got any questions
about the music?

01:20:12.731 --> 01:20:14.098
Freddie! Freddie!
Freddie!

01:20:14.100 --> 01:20:16.166
Freddie! Freddie,
your parents...

01:20:16.168 --> 01:20:18.102
they're conservative
Zoroastrians.

01:20:18.104 --> 01:20:20.737
I wonder, what do they make
of your public persona?

01:20:20.739 --> 01:20:21.805
Is that music...

01:20:21.807 --> 01:20:23.339
My parents died
in a fiery wreck.

01:20:23.341 --> 01:20:25.977
I happen to know
that's not true, is it?

01:20:25.979 --> 01:20:29.079
I just wanted to know whether
they were proud of you.

01:20:29.081 --> 01:20:31.081
Are your parents
proud of you?

01:20:31.083 --> 01:20:32.782
Is this what they hoped for?

01:20:32.784 --> 01:20:33.951
I hope that they are.

01:20:33.953 --> 01:20:35.285
I surely don't think so.

01:20:35.287 --> 01:20:37.086
Anyone wanna talk
about the album?

01:20:37.088 --> 01:20:38.155
Freddie! Freddie!
Freddie!

01:20:38.157 --> 01:20:39.656
Could you answer
my questions please?

01:20:39.658 --> 01:20:41.558
This better be good.

01:20:41.560 --> 01:20:42.660
Shut up!

01:20:42.662 --> 01:20:44.894
Freddie, could you
tell us about the rumors

01:20:44.896 --> 01:20:46.696
concerning your sexuality?

01:20:46.698 --> 01:20:47.764
What about the rumors

01:20:47.766 --> 01:20:49.433
concerning your lack
of sexuality?

01:20:49.435 --> 01:20:51.972
I'm just a musical prostitute,
my dear.

01:20:52.939 --> 01:20:55.141
Can you answer
the question?

01:20:55.774 --> 01:20:57.074
What's your name, dear?

01:20:57.076 --> 01:20:58.442
Shelley Stern.

01:20:58.444 --> 01:20:59.677
- Shelley.
- Yes.

01:20:59.679 --> 01:21:01.711
That thing between your legs,
does it bite?

01:21:01.713 --> 01:21:02.912
Hah!

01:21:02.914 --> 01:21:04.749
Could you answer the question,
please?

01:21:04.751 --> 01:21:05.849
We're here as a courtesy.

01:21:05.851 --> 01:21:07.018
You know, there's
four of us up here.

01:21:07.020 --> 01:21:08.152
What are you afraid of,
Freddie?

01:21:08.154 --> 01:21:09.519
What do you want?

01:21:09.521 --> 01:21:10.655
What is the truth?

01:21:10.657 --> 01:21:12.255
Can you be honest for once?

01:21:12.257 --> 01:21:13.958
Why are you lying
about your parents, Freddie?

01:21:13.960 --> 01:21:16.360
I'm not lying about anything.
I just, I'm...

01:21:16.362 --> 01:21:17.928
Your fans deserve
to know the truth, Freddie.

01:21:17.930 --> 01:21:19.028
Can you answer the question,
please?

01:21:19.030 --> 01:21:20.397
This is my business.

01:21:20.399 --> 01:21:21.799
No, you're a public figure.

01:21:21.801 --> 01:21:23.099
What are you afraid of,
Freddie?

01:21:23.101 --> 01:21:24.101
- Your parents?
- Can you tell us

01:21:24.103 --> 01:21:25.436
- about...
- Your sexuality?

01:21:25.438 --> 01:21:26.602
What? Why, why...

01:21:26.604 --> 01:21:27.905
Can you just be honest?

01:21:27.907 --> 01:21:28.972
Contracting something.

01:21:28.974 --> 01:21:30.342
Your fans deserve
to know the truth.

01:21:37.917 --> 01:21:39.348

01:21:39.350 --> 01:21:41.518

<i>MTV banned our video.</i>

01:23:20.118 --> 01:23:23.853

01:23:23.855 --> 01:23:25.123
It's America.

01:23:25.125 --> 01:23:27.190
They're Puritans in public,
perverts in private.

01:23:27.192 --> 01:23:28.826
I'm never touring
in the U.S. again.

01:23:28.828 --> 01:23:31.831
And I'm
the one being blamed for it.

01:23:32.532 --> 01:23:33.731
Not you, dear...

01:23:33.733 --> 01:23:36.269
whose idea, I believe, it was
to dress up in drag.

01:23:36.802 --> 01:23:38.134
And not you.

01:23:38.136 --> 01:23:40.638

who wrote the bloody thing.

01:23:40.640 --> 01:23:42.205
No.

Freddie the freak.
Freddie the fag.

01:23:49.547 --> 01:23:52.183
I'm tired of touring.
Aren't you?

01:23:52.185 --> 01:23:54.818
Album, tour, album, tour.

01:23:54.820 --> 01:23:56.254
I want to do
something different.

01:23:56.256 --> 01:23:58.254
We're a band.
That's what bands do.

01:23:58.256 --> 01:23:59.822

01:23:59.824 --> 01:24:00.894
Well, I need a break.

01:24:01.827 --> 01:24:03.294
I'm sick of it.

01:24:03.296 --> 01:24:04.697
What are you saying,
Freddie?

01:24:23.314 --> 01:24:26.285
I've signed a deal
with CBS Records.

01:24:27.219 --> 01:24:29.052
- You've done what?
- Without telling us?

01:24:29.054 --> 01:24:30.387
What kind of deal?

01:24:30.389 --> 01:24:33.193
Look, I'm not saying we won't
record or ever tour again.

01:24:33.759 --> 01:24:35.026
Queen will go on.

01:24:35.028 --> 01:24:36.660
But I need to do
something different.

01:24:36.662 --> 01:24:40.296
Do you know what I mean?
I need to grow.

01:24:40.298 --> 01:24:43.433
What's the song?
"Fly away"?

01:24:43.435 --> 01:24:44.968
"Spread my wings
and fly away."

01:24:44.970 --> 01:24:46.306
"Spread my wings
and fly away."

01:24:47.006 --> 01:24:48.371
A solo album?

01:24:48.373 --> 01:24:49.572
Two, actually.

01:24:49.574 --> 01:24:51.075
- Back to back.
- Another word out of you...

01:24:51.077 --> 01:24:52.541
and I'll throw you out
the bloody window.

01:24:52.543 --> 01:24:54.577
But that's years, Freddie.
I mean...

01:24:54.579 --> 01:24:56.781
- that'll take years.
- Ye of little faith.

01:24:56.783 --> 01:24:58.616
I don't believe this.

01:24:58.618 --> 01:24:59.619
How much?

01:25:04.122 --> 01:25:05.824
What did they pay you?

01:25:08.226 --> 01:25:09.893
I wanna know how much
they paid you...

01:25:09.895 --> 01:25:11.231
$4 million!

01:25:15.301 --> 01:25:17.034
That's more than
any Queen deal.

01:25:17.036 --> 01:25:18.735
Look, the routine
is killing us.

01:25:18.737 --> 01:25:21.772
I mean, you must all want a
break from all the arguments.

01:25:21.774 --> 01:25:23.808
I mean, whose song
gets on the album...

01:25:23.810 --> 01:25:25.142
whose song's the single...

01:25:25.144 --> 01:25:26.343
who wrote what...

01:25:26.345 --> 01:25:28.044
who gets a bigger slice
of the royalties...

01:25:28.046 --> 01:25:29.446
what's on the B-side,
all of it.

01:25:29.448 --> 01:25:31.048
You must need a break.

01:25:31.050 --> 01:25:32.650
Freddie, we're a family.

01:25:32.652 --> 01:25:34.117
No, we're not!

01:25:34.119 --> 01:25:35.419
We're not a family!

01:25:35.421 --> 01:25:37.888
You've got families,
children, wives.

01:25:37.890 --> 01:25:39.121
What have I got?

01:25:39.123 --> 01:25:41.661
You've got $4 million. Perhaps
you can buy yourself a family.

01:25:44.896 --> 01:25:47.464
I won't compromise
my vision any longer.

01:25:47.466 --> 01:25:49.666
Compromise?

01:25:49.668 --> 01:25:50.800
Are you joking?

01:25:50.802 --> 01:25:53.840
You were working at Heathrow
before we gave you a chance.

01:25:55.807 --> 01:25:58.174
And without me...

01:25:58.176 --> 01:26:00.376
you'd be a dentist...

01:26:00.378 --> 01:26:03.112
drumming 12/8-time blues
at the weekend

01:26:03.114 --> 01:26:04.548
at the Crown and Anchor.

01:26:04.550 --> 01:26:05.682
And you.

01:26:05.684 --> 01:26:08.552
Well, you would be
Dr. Brian May...

01:26:08.554 --> 01:26:12.188
author of a fascinating
dissertation on the cosmos...

01:26:12.190 --> 01:26:13.626
that no one ever reads.

01:26:14.594 --> 01:26:16.192
And Deacy...

01:26:16.194 --> 01:26:17.996
for the life of me...

01:26:19.030 --> 01:26:20.867
nothing comes to mind.

01:26:22.268 --> 01:26:24.166
I studied
electrical engineering.

01:26:24.168 --> 01:26:25.671
Does that meet
your standard?

01:26:26.604 --> 01:26:27.906
Perfect.

01:26:35.389 --> 01:26:36.963
You just killed Queen.

01:26:36.965 --> 01:26:38.701
Oh, give it a kiss one day.
She might wake up.

01:26:38.703 --> 01:26:39.905
You need us, Freddie.

01:26:41.039 --> 01:26:42.171
More than you know.

01:26:42.173 --> 01:26:43.575
I don't need anyone.

01:27:07.731 --> 01:27:08.866
<i>Hello?</i>

01:27:09.600 --> 01:27:11.567
Paul.
Can I speak to Freddie?

01:27:11.569 --> 01:27:14.202
Oh, Mary.
No, he can't talk right now.

01:27:14.204 --> 01:27:16.271
He's working day and night,
constantly.

01:27:16.273 --> 01:27:17.974
Will you make sure
to tell him that I called?

01:27:17.976 --> 01:27:20.475
Don't worry,
he's in safe hands.

01:27:20.477 --> 01:27:22.446
I will certainly
tell him you called.

01:27:23.713 --> 01:27:24.815
Cheers.

01:27:40.330 --> 01:27:42.665
Freddie, it's really great.

01:27:42.667 --> 01:27:43.735
It's shit!

01:27:46.036 --> 01:27:47.101
Just leave it.

01:27:47.103 --> 01:27:48.170
<i>Yeah,
hang on one second.</i>

01:27:49.441 --> 01:27:51.506
Give it more treble.

01:27:54.879 --> 01:27:57.145
<i>Where is he? Is he
there? I wanna speak to him.</i>

01:27:57.147 --> 01:27:59.047
He is working himself
to the bone.

01:27:59.049 --> 01:28:01.483
I'm blue in the face trying
to get him to take a break.

01:28:01.485 --> 01:28:02.650
<i>Paul, listen to me.</i>

01:28:02.652 --> 01:28:04.619
<i>It's one performance
for a good cause.</i>

01:28:04.621 --> 01:28:07.290
It's a televised concert
for the famine in Ethiopia.

01:28:07.292 --> 01:28:09.024
<i>They're gonna have
simultaneous performances</i>

01:28:09.026 --> 01:28:10.359
in Philadelphia and London.

01:28:10.361 --> 01:28:12.360
There's gonna be
a billion people watching.

01:28:12.362 --> 01:28:13.628
<i>Queen should be part of it.</i>

01:28:13.630 --> 01:28:14.796
<i>He's just been
really focused.</i>

01:28:14.798 --> 01:28:16.333
<i>But I'll be sure
to pass it on.</i>

01:28:17.636 --> 01:28:19.303
Sure you will.

01:29:23.234 --> 01:29:24.299
Hi.

01:29:24.301 --> 01:29:26.737
Hi.
Come in, come in.

01:29:28.472 --> 01:29:30.573
Why did you
come all this way?

01:29:30.575 --> 01:29:32.341
I just haven't heard
from you in so long,

01:29:32.343 --> 01:29:34.376
and I phoned and phoned,
and then...

01:29:34.378 --> 01:29:35.845
last night I just had
this terrible dream

01:29:35.847 --> 01:29:38.314
that something bad
had happened.

01:29:38.316 --> 01:29:40.815
No, no.
I've been working, that's all.

01:29:40.817 --> 01:29:44.185
Freddie, you're burning
the candle at both ends.

01:29:44.187 --> 01:29:45.889
Yes, but the glow
is so divine.

01:29:50.294 --> 01:29:51.726
Being human
is a condition

01:29:51.728 --> 01:29:54.598
that requires
a little anesthesia.

01:29:55.732 --> 01:29:57.934
- I miss you.
- I miss you.

01:29:57.936 --> 01:29:59.835
I miss you so much.

01:29:59.837 --> 01:30:02.440
Listen, but I have to finish
the second album.

01:30:03.240 --> 01:30:04.442
I need you.

01:30:05.075 --> 01:30:07.342
Stay. Stay here with me.

01:30:07.344 --> 01:30:09.047
Just you and me.

01:30:10.246 --> 01:30:11.749
I need the love of my life.

01:30:16.154 --> 01:30:17.155
Freddie...

01:30:17.887 --> 01:30:19.387
What about Queen?

01:30:19.389 --> 01:30:20.655
Jim told me he's been trying

01:30:20.657 --> 01:30:22.224
to contact you
about Live Aid...

01:30:22.226 --> 01:30:24.094
and you won't
take his calls.

01:30:25.396 --> 01:30:26.731
What is Live Aid?

01:30:28.231 --> 01:30:29.466
You haven't heard?

01:30:30.301 --> 01:30:31.567
Freddie,
it's the biggest concert

01:30:31.569 --> 01:30:33.801
there's ever been
or ever will be.

01:30:33.803 --> 01:30:35.671
It's for the famine
in Africa.

01:30:35.673 --> 01:30:38.107
Well, perhaps Paul thought
it wasn't a good idea.

01:30:38.109 --> 01:30:39.475
A distraction from my work.

01:30:39.477 --> 01:30:41.844
That's what's important,
that I finish this album.

01:30:41.846 --> 01:30:44.345
Stay with me, darling,
and I'll be all right.

01:30:44.347 --> 01:30:45.613
Freddie,
I can't stay with you.

01:30:45.615 --> 01:30:48.082
Of course you can.
I need you, Mary.

01:30:48.084 --> 01:30:49.920
Freddie, I'm pregnant.

01:31:03.200 --> 01:31:04.735
How could you?

01:31:06.035 --> 01:31:07.806
How could I?

01:31:08.940 --> 01:31:11.206
Freddie, this has nothing
to do with you.

01:31:11.208 --> 01:31:12.341
Come on. Let's get in.

01:31:12.343 --> 01:31:14.009
I bought some nibbles.

01:31:14.011 --> 01:31:15.210
Freddie.

01:31:15.212 --> 01:31:16.915
Sorry we're late.

01:31:17.714 --> 01:31:18.715
Mary.

01:31:19.749 --> 01:31:21.886
What a pleasant surprise.

01:31:23.486 --> 01:31:26.220
Hans. Everyone, come in.

01:31:26.222 --> 01:31:27.825
Milan,
make our guests comfortable.

01:31:30.928 --> 01:31:34.063
I wish I knew
you were coming to stay.

01:31:34.065 --> 01:31:35.663
I'd have scrubbed the place.

01:31:35.665 --> 01:31:37.565
Actually, I'm not staying.

01:31:37.567 --> 01:31:40.038
Wait. Mary, wait. Don't go.

01:31:42.373 --> 01:31:44.542
You told me
you had a dream.

01:31:45.543 --> 01:31:47.011
What was it?

01:31:48.212 --> 01:31:51.049
I was trying
to talk to you, but...

01:31:51.815 --> 01:31:54.315
it was like
talking to my father.

01:31:54.317 --> 01:31:56.753
You needed
to tell me something...

01:31:57.722 --> 01:31:59.624
but you couldn't say it.

01:32:01.157 --> 01:32:03.794
Because you had no voice.

01:32:07.264 --> 01:32:10.632
Freddie, come and
say hello to our new guests.

01:32:10.634 --> 01:32:12.868
They're dying to meet you.

01:32:12.870 --> 01:32:15.206
He'll be one second.

01:32:16.874 --> 01:32:17.875
Mary!

01:32:28.718 --> 01:32:31.088
I'm happy for you, Mary.

01:32:32.556 --> 01:32:34.192
Truly, I am.

01:32:39.062 --> 01:32:40.264
It's just...

01:32:42.532 --> 01:32:44.265
I'm frightened.

01:32:44.267 --> 01:32:46.935
Freddie,
you don't need to be.

01:32:46.937 --> 01:32:50.338
Because no matter what,
you are loved.

01:32:50.340 --> 01:32:53.141
By me, by Brian,
Deacy, Roger...

01:32:53.143 --> 01:32:54.712
your family.

01:32:56.379 --> 01:32:58.215
It's enough.

01:32:59.316 --> 01:33:01.683
And these people...

01:33:01.685 --> 01:33:04.720
they don't care about you.

01:33:04.722 --> 01:33:07.191
Paul doesn't care about you.

01:33:08.491 --> 01:33:11.094
You don't belong here,
Freddie.

01:33:13.030 --> 01:33:14.599
Come home.

01:33:19.003 --> 01:33:20.638
Home.

01:33:43.994 --> 01:33:45.295
Freddie!

01:33:48.900 --> 01:33:51.603
What are you doing?
You'll catch your death.

01:33:52.503 --> 01:33:55.306
Why didn't you tell me
about Live Aid?

01:33:57.240 --> 01:33:59.377
The Africa charity gig?

01:34:00.378 --> 01:34:02.344
It'll be an embarrassment.

01:34:02.346 --> 01:34:03.915
I didn't wanna
waste your time.

01:34:07.817 --> 01:34:09.650
You should have told me.

01:34:09.652 --> 01:34:11.121
Of course I did.

01:34:11.955 --> 01:34:13.021
You forgot.

01:34:13.023 --> 01:34:15.657
You're always
forgetting things.

01:34:15.659 --> 01:34:17.395
Come in now
and have a drink.

01:34:21.731 --> 01:34:23.066
You're out.

01:34:23.767 --> 01:34:24.969
What do you mean?

01:34:26.669 --> 01:34:29.206
I want you out of my life.

01:34:32.542 --> 01:34:33.775
'Cause I'm the only one left,

01:34:33.777 --> 01:34:35.045
you're blaming me
for everything?

01:34:36.280 --> 01:34:38.148
I blame myself.

01:34:39.549 --> 01:34:40.985
So I'm out?

01:34:41.584 --> 01:34:43.053
Just like that?

01:34:44.087 --> 01:34:46.657
After everything
we've been through?

01:34:48.426 --> 01:34:50.794
Just think of
the photos I have.

01:34:51.727 --> 01:34:54.665
I know who you are,
Freddie Mercury.

01:34:57.735 --> 01:35:00.838
You know when
you know you've gone rotten?

01:35:03.173 --> 01:35:04.676
Really rotten?

01:35:06.744 --> 01:35:08.212
Fruit flies.

01:35:09.346 --> 01:35:13.047
Dirty little fruit flies.

01:35:13.049 --> 01:35:15.917
Coming to feast
on what's left.

01:35:15.919 --> 01:35:19.357
Well, there isn't much left
for you to feast on anymore.

01:35:21.691 --> 01:35:23.058
So, fly off.

01:35:23.060 --> 01:35:27.362
Do what you like with your
photographs and your stories.

01:35:27.364 --> 01:35:30.101
But promise me one thing.

01:35:31.134 --> 01:35:33.404
That I never see
your face again.

01:35:34.638 --> 01:35:36.007
Ever.

01:35:37.273 --> 01:35:38.276
I didn't mean it.

01:35:40.744 --> 01:35:42.947
I'm sorry!
Freddie, come back!

01:35:43.847 --> 01:35:45.750
I'll make it better.

01:36:00.998 --> 01:36:02.497
<i>But, Peter,
you might be right.</i>

01:36:02.499 --> 01:36:03.765
<i>I'm not even hurt</i>

01:36:03.767 --> 01:36:05.067
<i>by the fact that
he's let me go as a friend.</i>

01:36:05.069 --> 01:36:07.769
<i>But you can only be there
so much for a person.</i>

01:36:07.771 --> 01:36:09.438
<i>And so, Mr. Prenter...</i>

01:36:09.440 --> 01:36:10.305
<i>all these stories</i>

01:36:10.307 --> 01:36:13.341
<i>about Freddie Mercury
and his lovers...</i>

01:36:13.343 --> 01:36:14.978
<i>that there were so many.</i>

01:36:15.512 --> 01:36:16.811
<i>Yeah?</i>

01:36:16.813 --> 01:36:18.813
- <i>Is it really true?</i>
- <i>Yes, it is.</i>

01:36:18.815 --> 01:36:20.482
<i>His lovers were countless.</i>

01:36:20.484 --> 01:36:22.186
<i>Genuinely countless. Uh...</i>

01:36:23.087 --> 01:36:26.787
<i>All these wild,
drug-fueled parties...</i>

01:36:26.789 --> 01:36:30.225
<i>where he'd find
another lover every night...</i>

01:36:30.227 --> 01:36:32.461
<i>and a routine
he couldn't get out of.</i>

01:36:32.463 --> 01:36:34.363
<i>So, you really
did see behind the mask?</i>

01:36:34.365 --> 01:36:37.099
<i>I knew Freddie when
he did</i> Bohemian Rhapsody.

01:36:37.101 --> 01:36:39.701
<i>And the Freddie we have now...</i>

01:36:39.703 --> 01:36:41.769
<i>he doesn't have
the same passion about music.</i>

01:36:43.706 --> 01:36:45.008
Hello?

01:36:47.111 --> 01:36:48.112
Hello?

01:36:48.579 --> 01:36:49.781
Miami?

01:36:50.746 --> 01:36:51.814
Freddie?

01:36:51.816 --> 01:36:52.881
<i>How are you?</i>

01:36:52.883 --> 01:36:55.617
There was
this Africa concert...

01:36:55.619 --> 01:36:57.551
that wants Queen to play.

01:36:57.553 --> 01:36:59.220
<i>Is that still...</i>

01:36:59.222 --> 01:37:00.354
You mean Live Aid?

01:37:00.356 --> 01:37:02.591
<i>They've announced
all the bands, Freddie.</i>

01:37:02.593 --> 01:37:04.295
<i>It's too late.</i>

01:37:05.495 --> 01:37:06.961
I need...

01:37:06.963 --> 01:37:09.497
I need to reconnect
with the mothership.

01:37:09.499 --> 01:37:11.800
Freddie, they don't want
anything to do with you.

01:37:11.802 --> 01:37:14.071
<i>They're still very upset.</i>

01:37:14.804 --> 01:37:16.805
Maybe if you ask them...

01:37:16.807 --> 01:37:18.172
<i>they would meet me.</i>

01:37:18.174 --> 01:37:20.277
<i>Tell them I want to talk.</i>

01:37:21.111 --> 01:37:22.377
Just talk.

01:37:26.517 --> 01:37:28.219
We're family.

01:37:31.355 --> 01:37:32.857
You know, family...

01:37:33.824 --> 01:37:35.493
have fights...

01:37:37.460 --> 01:37:39.096
all the time.

01:37:39.596 --> 01:37:41.132
I can call.

01:37:41.664 --> 01:37:43.100
Thank you...

01:37:45.067 --> 01:37:46.033
Jim.

01:37:46.035 --> 01:37:47.936
<i>As this friend,
somebody who...</i>

01:37:47.938 --> 01:37:50.805
<i>probably knows Freddie Mercury
better than anybody else...</i>

01:37:50.807 --> 01:37:54.312
<i>how would you describe him
inside as a person?</i>

01:37:55.312 --> 01:37:57.278
<i>For me,
Freddie will always be...</i>

01:37:57.280 --> 01:37:59.913
<i>this frightened
little Pakkie boy...</i>

01:37:59.915 --> 01:38:01.949
<i>who's afraid to be alone.</i>

01:38:01.951 --> 01:38:03.284
<i>I hope he sees this</i>

01:38:03.286 --> 01:38:05.453
<i>and realizes
what he has lost in you.</i>

01:38:05.455 --> 01:38:06.921
<i>I hope he does, too.</i>

01:38:06.923 --> 01:38:09.326
<i>A close and important friend.</i>

01:38:25.342 --> 01:38:26.878
Where are they?

01:38:27.477 --> 01:38:28.945
They're late.

01:38:36.520 --> 01:38:37.652
Hi, guys.

01:38:37.654 --> 01:38:38.955
Jim.

01:38:40.857 --> 01:38:42.757
If anybody wants
any tea, coffee...

01:38:42.759 --> 01:38:44.160
bladed weapons...

01:38:45.495 --> 01:38:46.931
just ask.

01:38:48.632 --> 01:38:49.634
So...

01:38:51.067 --> 01:38:52.399
who wants to go first?

01:38:52.401 --> 01:38:53.570
I'll start.

01:38:55.472 --> 01:38:57.005
I've been hideous.

01:38:57.007 --> 01:38:59.140
I know that, and...

01:38:59.142 --> 01:39:00.578
I deserve your fury.

01:39:01.678 --> 01:39:03.047
I've been conceited...

01:39:04.580 --> 01:39:06.150
selfish.

01:39:09.620 --> 01:39:11.586
Well, an asshole, basically.

01:39:11.588 --> 01:39:12.956
Strong beginning.

01:39:14.290 --> 01:39:16.291
Look, I'm happy to
strip off my shirt...

01:39:16.293 --> 01:39:18.596
and flagellate myself
before you.

01:39:21.397 --> 01:39:23.831
Or rather, I could ask you
a simple question.

01:39:23.833 --> 01:39:25.169
I'm good
with the flagellation.

01:39:29.972 --> 01:39:32.741
What's it gonna take
for you all to forgive me?

01:39:32.743 --> 01:39:34.645
Is that what you want,
Freddie?

01:39:35.980 --> 01:39:37.112
I forgive you.

01:39:37.114 --> 01:39:38.982
- Is that it? Can we go now?
- No.

01:39:44.954 --> 01:39:46.653
I went to Munich.

01:39:46.655 --> 01:39:48.357
I hired a bunch of guys.

01:39:48.359 --> 01:39:50.625
I told them exactly
what I wanted them to do...

01:39:50.627 --> 01:39:52.062
and the problem was...

01:39:54.897 --> 01:39:56.132
they did it.

01:39:57.901 --> 01:40:00.271
No pushback from Roger.

01:40:01.771 --> 01:40:03.440
None of your rewrites.

01:40:04.141 --> 01:40:06.009
None of his funny looks.

01:40:10.547 --> 01:40:12.049
I need you.

01:40:15.652 --> 01:40:17.253
And you need me.

01:40:21.624 --> 01:40:22.857
Let's face it.

01:40:22.859 --> 01:40:24.594
We're not bad
for four aging queens.

01:40:27.030 --> 01:40:29.064
So, um, go ahead.

01:40:29.066 --> 01:40:31.035
Name your terms.

01:40:32.468 --> 01:40:34.739
Could you give us a moment,
please, Fred?

01:40:51.154 --> 01:40:52.720
Why'd you do that?

01:40:52.722 --> 01:40:54.725
I just felt like it.

01:41:06.703 --> 01:41:09.473
They'll be all right.
They just need a bit of time.

01:41:11.273 --> 01:41:13.310
What if I don't have time?

01:41:15.745 --> 01:41:17.548
What do you mean, Fred?

01:41:23.352 --> 01:41:25.522
You can come back in now,
if you'd like.

01:41:31.660 --> 01:41:32.663
We decided...

01:41:34.063 --> 01:41:35.266
What did we decide?

01:41:35.799 --> 01:41:37.131
From now on...

01:41:37.133 --> 01:41:40.702
every song, no matter
who wrote it, music, lyrics...

01:41:40.704 --> 01:41:42.203
it's by Queen.

01:41:42.205 --> 01:41:44.706
Not one of us, just Queen.

01:41:44.708 --> 01:41:46.608
All the money,
all the credits,

01:41:46.610 --> 01:41:48.510
split four ways evenly.

01:41:48.512 --> 01:41:49.743
Done.

01:41:49.745 --> 01:41:51.945
We have a problem
with the people around you.

01:41:51.947 --> 01:41:53.348
Paul is out.
I fired him.

01:41:53.350 --> 01:41:55.683
- On what pretext?
- Villainy.

01:41:55.685 --> 01:41:56.984
What else?

01:41:56.986 --> 01:41:58.153
Bob Geldof.

01:41:58.155 --> 01:42:00.221
I called to convince him
to squeeze you guys

01:42:00.223 --> 01:42:02.157
into the lineup
for the Live Aid concert...

01:42:02.159 --> 01:42:04.126
but he wants an answer now.

01:42:04.128 --> 01:42:06.230
You have to make a decision.

01:42:07.664 --> 01:42:09.230
Every ticket's already sold.

01:42:09.232 --> 01:42:11.132
100,000 people at Wembley...

01:42:11.134 --> 01:42:14.368
100,000 people at
JFK Stadium in Philadelphia...

01:42:14.370 --> 01:42:18.006
a global TV audience around
the world of 150 countries...

01:42:18.008 --> 01:42:19.841
13 satellites.

01:42:19.843 --> 01:42:22.978
The Olympics only had three.

01:42:22.980 --> 01:42:25.012
We haven't
played together in years.

01:42:25.014 --> 01:42:26.514
It's kinda suicide
to play again...

01:42:26.516 --> 01:42:28.382
for the first time
in front of millions.

01:42:28.384 --> 01:42:31.387
Try over 1.5 billion.

01:42:32.289 --> 01:42:35.055
"Who are
these four dinosaurs?"

01:42:35.057 --> 01:42:36.558
"Where's Madonna?"

01:42:36.560 --> 01:42:39.163
It's a 20-minute set.
Everyone gets the same.

01:42:39.663 --> 01:42:41.665
Jagger, Bowie...

01:42:42.531 --> 01:42:43.998
Elton...

01:42:44.000 --> 01:42:46.835
McCartney, The Who...

01:42:46.837 --> 01:42:48.369
Led Zeppelin...

01:42:48.371 --> 01:42:51.275
Phil Collins,
REO Speedwagon...

01:42:52.008 --> 01:42:53.641
Bob Dylan.

01:42:53.643 --> 01:42:54.710
Certainly good company.

01:42:54.712 --> 01:42:56.877
Anybody who is anybody
is doing this concert.

01:42:56.879 --> 01:42:58.145
Look.

01:42:58.147 --> 01:42:59.648
All I know...

01:42:59.650 --> 01:43:03.587
is that if we wake up
the day after this concert...

01:43:04.187 --> 01:43:06.523
and we didn't do our part...

01:43:07.758 --> 01:43:10.728
we're going to regret it
till the day we die.

01:43:17.801 --> 01:43:19.236
Please.

01:43:26.276 --> 01:43:28.042
<i>Every day, in San Francisco,</i>

01:43:28.044 --> 01:43:30.077
<i>two more men
hear the grim news...</i>

01:43:30.079 --> 01:43:31.746
<i>"You have AIDS,
there's no cure."</i>

01:43:31.748 --> 01:43:33.614
<i>Since doctors
in France and America</i>

01:43:33.616 --> 01:43:35.683
<i>isolated the virus in 1983...</i>

01:43:35.685 --> 01:43:38.385
<i>research has proceeded
at a frantic pace.</i>

01:43:38.387 --> 01:43:40.087
<i>The method used by the virus</i>

01:43:40.089 --> 01:43:42.023
<i>to destroy
the body's immune system...</i>

01:43:42.025 --> 01:43:43.391
<i>has been discovered...</i>

01:43:43.393 --> 01:43:46.560
<i>but a cure still seems
many years away.</i>

01:43:46.562 --> 01:43:49.096
<i>A major breakthrough
has been a new blood test...</i>

01:43:49.098 --> 01:43:50.598
<i>that should ensure
that in future...</i>

01:43:50.600 --> 01:43:53.534
<i>nobody contracts AIDS
from a blood transfusion.</i>

01:43:53.536 --> 01:43:55.670
<i>But it's only just
been approved for use.</i>

01:43:55.672 --> 01:44:01.475
<i>♪ What is this thing
that builds our dreams</i>

01:44:01.477 --> 01:44:07.518
<i>♪ Yet slips away from us?</i>

01:44:09.186 --> 01:44:15.590
<i>♪ Who wants to live forever?</i>

01:44:15.592 --> 01:44:22.266
<i>♪ Who wants to live forever?</i>

01:44:29.106 --> 01:44:33.277

01:44:55.865 --> 01:44:57.468
Do you understand?

01:44:58.735 --> 01:45:04.204
The way we go from here is
that treatments are available.

01:45:04.206 --> 01:45:06.944
They're not particularly
effective, Freddie.

01:45:33.035 --> 01:45:34.704
Eh-oh!

01:45:43.713 --> 01:45:45.747
Eh-oh.

01:46:19.682 --> 01:46:20.683
Yep.

01:46:21.183 --> 01:46:22.483
Mmm-hmm.

01:46:22.485 --> 01:46:23.887
- Let's call it. Yeah?
- Yeah, yeah.

01:46:24.954 --> 01:46:25.988
Sorry.

01:46:26.889 --> 01:46:27.891
I sound like shit.

01:46:29.392 --> 01:46:31.895
You all are lovely,
you sound good.

01:46:32.730 --> 01:46:34.295
Been a while.

01:46:34.297 --> 01:46:36.398
My throat feels like
a vulture's crotch.

01:46:36.400 --> 01:46:38.433
We still got a week.

01:46:38.435 --> 01:46:39.600
We'll get there.

01:46:39.602 --> 01:46:41.502
Yeah, we're in
a good place, Fred.

01:46:41.504 --> 01:46:43.574
You just need a bit of rest,
that's all.

01:46:44.740 --> 01:46:45.743
Yeah.

01:46:46.276 --> 01:46:47.442
Get a drink, Rog?

01:46:47.444 --> 01:46:48.609
Yeah,
there's a nice little pub

01:46:48.611 --> 01:46:50.511
- down the road, actually.
- Can I come?

01:46:50.513 --> 01:46:51.578
We're just an exclusive...

01:46:51.580 --> 01:46:53.448
No, of course not.
Invite-only.

01:46:53.450 --> 01:46:54.515
Yeah,
that's kind of you.

01:46:54.517 --> 01:46:56.086
Before you leave...

01:46:58.320 --> 01:47:00.387
Could I have a second?

01:47:00.389 --> 01:47:02.426
Yeah. What's up?

01:47:05.261 --> 01:47:06.797
I've got it.

01:47:08.699 --> 01:47:09.933
Got what?

01:47:10.866 --> 01:47:12.034
AIDS.

01:47:14.103 --> 01:47:16.472
I wanted you to
hear it from me.

01:47:17.708 --> 01:47:19.573
Fred, I'm so sorry.

01:47:19.575 --> 01:47:21.141
Brian, stop.

01:47:21.143 --> 01:47:22.512
Don't.

01:47:25.048 --> 01:47:27.215
For right now...

01:47:27.217 --> 01:47:28.350
it's between us.

01:47:28.352 --> 01:47:30.487
All right? Just us.

01:47:31.120 --> 01:47:32.755
So, please...

01:47:33.522 --> 01:47:35.622
if any of you...

01:47:35.624 --> 01:47:39.493
fuss about it or frown
about it, or, worst of all...

01:47:39.495 --> 01:47:41.762
if you bore me
with your sympathy...

01:47:41.764 --> 01:47:43.831
that's just seconds wasted.

01:47:43.833 --> 01:47:46.667
Seconds that could be used
making music...

01:47:46.669 --> 01:47:49.537
which is all I want to do
with the time I have left.

01:47:49.539 --> 01:47:52.607
I don't have time
to be their victim...

01:47:52.609 --> 01:47:56.077
their AIDS poster boy,
their cautionary tale.

01:47:56.079 --> 01:47:58.882
No, I decide who I am.

01:47:59.982 --> 01:48:03.052
I'm going to be
what I was born to be.

01:48:04.353 --> 01:48:06.554
A performer...

01:48:06.556 --> 01:48:09.192
who gives the people
what they want.

01:48:13.562 --> 01:48:16.032
Touch of the heavens.

01:48:19.134 --> 01:48:21.472
Freddie fucking Mercury.

01:48:23.539 --> 01:48:25.676
You're a legend, Fred.

01:48:28.410 --> 01:48:31.045
You're bloody right I am.

01:48:31.047 --> 01:48:33.448
We're all legends.

01:48:33.450 --> 01:48:35.183
But you're right,
I am a legend.

01:48:35.185 --> 01:48:37.018
Now, you give me a chance

01:48:37.020 --> 01:48:39.723
to get my bitchy little
vocal cords in order...

01:48:41.289 --> 01:48:42.657
and we'll go and punch a hole

01:48:42.659 --> 01:48:44.728
through the roof
of that stadium.

01:48:46.329 --> 01:48:48.296
Actually,
Wembley doesn't have a roof.

01:48:49.732 --> 01:48:52.500
- All right.
- No, he's right. It doesn't.

01:48:52.502 --> 01:48:55.004
Then we'll punch a hole
in the sky.

01:49:00.243 --> 01:49:02.609
Now, even though you're crying
like three little girls...

01:49:02.611 --> 01:49:03.845
I still love you.

01:49:03.847 --> 01:49:04.979

01:49:04.981 --> 01:49:06.381
- Drink?
- Yes!

01:49:06.383 --> 01:49:07.584
Or ten?

01:49:24.034 --> 01:49:25.536
What are you looking at?

01:49:26.701 --> 01:49:28.304
You think

01:49:30.306 --> 01:49:31.439
Everyone's a critic.

01:49:31.441 --> 01:49:33.107
<i>It's 12:00 noon in London.</i>

01:49:33.109 --> 01:49:34.876

<i>But you can also pledge cash,

01:49:42.953 --> 01:49:44.685

coming in...

01:49:44.687 --> 01:49:46.319

01:49:46.321 --> 01:49:47.689

01:49:47.691 --> 01:49:49.556
They're playing for the good

01:49:49.558 --> 01:49:51.359
So get your money out now!

01:49:51.361 --> 01:49:53.159
And phone up
and give us the money.

01:49:53.161 --> 01:49:55.563
You've got plenty of it,
or if you got none of it...

01:49:55.565 --> 01:49:57.765

who are dying of starvation.

01:49:57.767 --> 01:50:00.635
We want to get a million
pounds out of this country.

01:50:00.637 --> 01:50:03.304

01:50:21.824 --> 01:50:23.890

01:50:27.030 --> 01:50:29.396

too easy for you.

01:50:31.334 --> 01:50:33.900
How have you been, Freddie?

01:50:33.902 --> 01:50:36.138
I've been a bit lost,
to be honest.

01:50:36.740 --> 01:50:38.439
You were right.

01:50:38.441 --> 01:50:40.110
I could do with a friend.

01:50:41.076 --> 01:50:43.144
Would you like

01:50:43.146 --> 01:50:44.147

01:50:57.826 --> 01:51:00.161
So, Jim,
how do you know Freddie?

01:51:00.163 --> 01:51:02.766
Do you work together?

01:51:13.677 --> 01:51:15.245
Jim's my friend.

01:51:20.950 --> 01:51:22.783
Wonderful to have friends.

01:51:22.785 --> 01:51:25.388

01:51:29.359 --> 01:51:31.359

- Your favorite, Freddie.

01:51:31.361 --> 01:51:32.592
We have to go, Mum.

01:51:32.594 --> 01:51:33.793
But you just got here, <i>beta.</i>

01:51:33.795 --> 01:51:34.996
What do you mean, "go"?

01:51:34.998 --> 01:51:37.165
We've gotta get to Wembley.

01:51:37.167 --> 01:51:38.666
Would you believe it?

01:51:38.668 --> 01:51:41.101
Jim's never been
to a rock concert.

01:51:41.103 --> 01:51:41.969
That's true.

01:51:41.971 --> 01:51:43.570
Queen are
playing at Live Aid.

01:51:43.572 --> 01:51:44.639
We're all doing our bit

01:51:44.641 --> 01:51:46.474
for the starving children
in Africa...

01:51:46.476 --> 01:51:48.812
and nobody's
taking any money.

01:51:53.367 --> 01:51:57.271
Good thoughts, good words,
good deeds.

01:51:59.405 --> 01:52:01.508
Just like you taught me, Papa.

01:52:16.855 --> 01:52:17.857
