1.Download mysql from here: MySQL :: Begin Your Download
2.Install this shit. It will make link from usrlocalmysql to directory were all shit is installed. So yeah, we need this path /usrlocal/mysql. Choose to use legacy encryption method.!important  (that bitch phpmyadmin may no connect to mysql if you choose new method).
3. Do not forget password you entered during installation!
4. Go to your $HOME or $home or ~/ directory. Find .bash_profile or create if it don’t exist.  Write this str : export PATH=${PATH}:usrlocalmysqlbin/ and save.  Now you can access mysql from anywhere. 
5. Go to spotlight and find mysqL.prefPane and launch it. Start mysql server if it don’t active, obviously.Go grub some beer to celebrate, you are brilliant. 
6. Download phpMyadmin here : phpMyAdmin - Downloads
7. Unzip files into directory which you use like root for your web projects (htdocs for instance)
8. Enter a following commands to prevent mysql 2002 socket error:
sudo mkdir varmysql
sudo ln -s tmpmysql.sock varmysql/mysql.sock (probably we can’t do it on Macs in cluster, so all we got left is hope that bitch error do not appear… or use some  alternative like adminer)
9. Rename “phpmyadmin-with-full-bunch-of-languages-you-will-never-use-but-it-is-cool-to-know-this-optinos-are-present” to “phpmyadmin”
10. Cd into phpmyadmin and make a new folder “config”
11. Chmod o+w config
12. Start server. Built-in : php -S localhost:8000 -t path to dir (Usersyou/htdocs for example)
13. In browser go to http://localhost:8000/phpmyadmin/setup/    
14. Click on Authentication tab. Fill up Password field with mysql root password (you set it during mysql installation)
15. iF in folder config doesn’t append a shit, download a conf file (there will be button) and put it into phpmyadmin. Remove config folder.  You shine as hell.  You can sip the beer  that you have from 5 step, don’t you left some? Still there is a job remaining.
16. Go to your .env and set the parameters: DB_HOST=127.0.0.1 or localhost, DB_PORT=3306(by default), DB_DATABASE=database name(I suggest to use “hypertube”), DB_USERNAME=root(if you don’t create your own, if you do it will be that username), DB_PASSWORD=your password, which was settled during mysql installation (recommended: “123”, “password”,  “admin”, “123456”, “your birth date” as most strong passwords in history)
17. Cd to project root directory(where artisan is present)
18. php artisan db:create
19. Php artisan migrate
20. Now you are done with this shit, go finish your beer. You irresistible.
