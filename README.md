## Installation

1. Clone the repository
```
git clone https://github.com/Navalag/hypertube_42.git
```

2. Go to /src directory
```
cd hypertube_42(or your folder)/src
```

3. Install composer (composer and laravel should be already installed, otherwise just google how to install)
```
php composer.phar install
```

4. Add .env with your database and other configurations.
In .env.example you will find sqlite connection. This is the simpliest way for fast start.
To run this way just create database/database.sqlite file.
```
cp .env.example .env
php artisan key:generate
touch database/database.sqlite (only if you want to use sqlite connection)
```

5. Run migrations.
```
php artisan migrate
```

6. Start php and node servers (you need php and node.js to be installed on your machine)
```
php artisan serve
cd src/public/stream
bash start.sh (wait few minutes to install all dependencies)
```
Now you can try to sign in with Oauth, to register with email you have to add MAIL_DRIVER to .env file.

**Thats it!** :ok_hand: you can now open project in browser.
